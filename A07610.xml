         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ever eſteemed, that the imployment of thoſe Talents, either naturally beſtowed on man by God, or acquired by ſtudy and induſtry, ought more properly yea and of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rather to be imployed in the ſervice of our King and Country, than to be made uſe of in the ſatisfaction of our private humours. I doe here (in acquittance of that generall obligation) adventure to offer up this poore mite of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, among the many learned &amp; elaborate workes which the choyce wits and learned pens of our age produce in all kindes. It is but a tranſlation: the originall belonging to a very learned and reverend French Author, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:13114:4"/>fluent ſtyle, and profound learning ſo happily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in his owne language, made mee not a little timorous to undertake to make him ſpeake Engliſh, being iuſtly apprehenſive as well of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him wrong, as diſgracing my ſelfe: but the zealous deſire <hi>I</hi> had to be ſerviceable to all ſuch ſtudious and worthy perſons, who haply not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the French language, are yet deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to enable and adorn themſelves with thoſe vertues and qualities requiſite for ſuch who by an honeſt and noble ambition doe any way ayme to be rightly uſefull for the ſervice of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne in the moſt eminent offices and charges of this great Empire, did ſo farre over-rule me, as I rather chooſe to undergoe that hazard, than to bereave them of ſo great a benefit by my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-much baſhfulneſſe. Now though the practiſe of thoſe things contained in this Treatiſe, belong properly to ſuch choyce perſons whoſe vertues, excellent endowments, or advantage of birth, together with our Soveraignes favours make capable for the conduct of weighty affaires, yet doth the ſpeculative part thereof indifferently appertaine to all generous ſpirits. I ſhall not need any further to commend the Author, his

The onely favour <hi>I</hi> am to require is for the Tranſlator, who if he have not ſufficiently acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or have come ſhort of thoſe lively expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions appearing in the originall: conſider (gentle Reader) that few Painters have ever beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to equalize the purtraits drawne by <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> in any there moſt exact copies. It would therefore prove an unexcuſable arrogancy in me, ſhould <hi>I</hi> have the leaſt imagination of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into compariſon with ſo excellent a French Penne, by any Engliſh of mine: if you pleaſe therefore to excuſe my defects, and accept of my good deſires you ſhall therein much incourage me to undertake the like labours in whatſoever I ſhall ſuppoſe may conduce to publicke utility.</p>

And truly J muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that this conceit had almoſt perſwaded mee to commit Paricide, and (as the <hi>Lamias</hi>) to ſmother mine owne Creature in his Cradle. For it being perhaps like thoſe untimely Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which according to Phyſicall tenets are not vitall: it had beene more advantagious for him to have received death with Patience, than to have expected it with Apprehenſion: ſpecially ſince parents have abſolute power of
<pb facs="tcp:13114:7"/>life and death over the babes of their braine, and that in this caſe onely, a voluntary death may with honour prevent, an ignominious end. But fatherly affection taking advice in favour of his children, hath ſuppreſſed this firſt motion, perſwading me it taſted more both of Humanity and conveniencie to abandon it, than to kill it. Now whether Reaſon hath rightly adviſed me, or Selfe-love deceived mee, I blame not my Friend. If any fault bee committed, I deſire not they ſhould beare the blame, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expoſe it to thy Iudgement, and lay it open to thy mercie: It may happen upon the like good Fortune as thoſe forlorne children doe, whoſe hazard often proves more advantagious to them than their Parents providence; their Fates relieving the infelicitie of their birth: but howſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to diſpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>I</hi> dedicate it to his Honour, and thy ſervice, and the deſigne it hath to become uſefull to thoſe who pleaſe to entertaine it, will (as <hi>I</hi> hope) cauſe it to deſerve from them, if not praiſe, yet at leaſt favour and pardon.

Now to the end to deliver thee a juſt account of my deſigne, and that you may know what you are to expect from mee in this worke, and how I proceed; I am to let you underſtand that here <hi>I</hi> ſpeake of the <hi>Politicall Art,</hi> as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> did of the <hi>Oratorial,</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore,</hi> where he rather treateth of the Eloquent, than of Eloquence; of the Orator than of this Art: ſo my obiect in this diſcourſe doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly touch upon the Art of <hi>Policy,</hi> but on the <hi>Politicke</hi> perſon; not on the matter, but the man, not on the Formes, Lawes, or Maximes of States, but on the vertues and qualities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for him who governes by his Councell, or by adminiſtring Iuſtice, under the Authority of aſoveraigne. Now ſince God is the finall end of man, and conſequently whatſoever concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth man, the ſoule and body, the ſpirituall and temporall, ought equally to ayme at God: and for the taking a true ſight, to receive the rule and conduct thereof from his divine Law, I therefore conſider <hi>Politicke</hi> Vertues, with the Order, habitude, and reference they ought to have to this finall end. Since humane Society, whether Eccleſiaſticall, or Civill, ought onely to
<pb facs="tcp:13114:8"/>tend to the happy ſocietie of Saints, and that in vaine the Eccleſiaſticall part endeavoreth to draw them thereto, if the Civile divere them.</p>

                  <hi>The Name.</hi> Ariſt. Non eſt amicitia inter Deum &amp; homines.</note> The ſame Subiect giveth it the Name of <hi>Chriſtian Politicks;</hi> for the Pagan Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers who have treated upon this Subiect, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not acknowledged God as the finall End of man, but holding there could not be any amity or correſpondency betweene two ſo infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: they have therefore not referred, either civill ſociety, or the direction thereof to this end. So that <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who knowing and adoring the true God, and apprehending by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation his great love towards us, and how he being our Center and Beatitude, we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all to him: cannot in this caſe finde in the Books of the ancient Sages, any exact, or perfect rule herein, but are to deduce their principles from a higher ſpring, and to levell their marke at the true obiect, if they deſire to draw a true and direct line.

<pb facs="tcp:13114:8"/>Faith, but of whatſoever belongeth to manners, life, adminiſtration of Offices, and conduct of affaires.</p>
            <p>The order and diviſion of this Diſcourſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the nature and quality of the ſubiect; and as the <hi>Politicke</hi> life conſiſteth not but in Action; and ſince in euery Action three things are neceſſarie, that is to ſay, What we are to do, our Will, and Power to effect the ſame: ſo doe I divide all my Worke into three parts. The firſt, whereof treateth of the qualities cauſing the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, to know what is requiſite or profitable for publicke good. The ſecond ſpeaketh of ſuch parts as are fitting for the perfectionating the honeſtie, and integritie to will, and deſire the good hee knoweth. The laſt diſcourſe to of ſuch ſufficiencies as adde vigor towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction thereof. The Wiſdome, Love, and Power of God go verneth all things on Earth. The light, heat, and force of the Sunne inſpire ſoule and life into all this Elementary World. Wiſdom, Goodneſſe, and Power, are the three motions in <hi>Policy.</hi> Theſe are the three darts of <hi>Iupiters</hi> Thunder, the three tines of <hi>Neptunes</hi> Trident, the three Lillies, adorning the Armes of our

            <p>As for my ſtile or way of writing, <hi>I</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to follow the iudgement of that Romane, who ſayes, <hi>The moſt efficacious way of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or writing is to ioyne Eloquence to VViſedome, perſwaſive words, to firm and ſolyde reaſons.</hi> And in this ſort have all the Antients proceeded, not Ethnicks onely, but the firſt Fathers, likewiſe of the Greeke and Latine Church. The meerely Scholaſticall ſtraine is good, and profitable in other ſubiects: but in this it would appeare over punctuall and ſmallie ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: and the Orator onely adorned with a pomp of ill placed words, tends rather to oſtentation than inſtruction. But when both theſe, the one having quitted her ſtrictneſſe, and roughneſſe; the other her colours and curioſitie, doe unitedly ioyne (in the ſame Oration) the one by contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting ſinewes, the other ornaments; the one force, the other lively Graces; the one what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth, the other what pleaſeth; they iointly yeeld what ſeverally they are unable to affoord: Flowers and Fruit Pleaſure and Profit. But though <hi>I</hi> be farre from attayning this point; yet
<pb facs="tcp:13114:9"/>have I (at leaſt) endeavoured to approch: It being ſufficient glory for me to have known and followed the better forme. Thoſe who onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rhapſodies of reſemblances, adaptations, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, and heaped Authorities, who frame not a body, but a monſter of diſcourſe, ſhall not perad venture finde here wherewith to ſatisfie their conceptions. For I will at firſt confeſſe I have not imployed my time in ſearching com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places, nor in turning over the tables of Bookes, to ſwell my volumes with the ſpoyles of others. The preciſe and neceſſary authorities for the proofe of what <hi>I</hi> ſpeake ſee me to me ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, leaving ſuperfluities to thoſe who are at bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leaſure to tranſcribe whole Authors, and to cauſe the world daily to ſee the Metempſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſis or tranſmigration not of Soules from one bodie to another, but of bookes from one paper to another. Or to imitate that Romane Emperour, who appropriated to himſelfe the pourtraicts of the gods, by onely taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the head and title, ſubſtituting his owne in their stead. Beſides, <hi>I</hi> will not defend this Booke from the Tongues of Zoiles, and detractors, (as ordinarilymen doe) ſince it
<pb facs="tcp:13114:10"/>were a vanity couched under pretext of Feare, to ſuppoſe ſo ſmall a Work as this, were worthy to be aſſaulted, and a meere fancie to forge Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and as in Theaters to arme them with intention to aſſaile them. It were too preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous an attemp, and no leſſe than to uſurpe not upon the perſons onely, but even upon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of a more violent Empire than that of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, ſhould <hi>I</hi> ſeeke to force the liberty of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with purpoſe to ſubject and captivate them to private opinions. Let therefore (who pleaſe approve of what I write, or reject it who liſt.

But my deſire to be profitable and not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, being the principall Engine giving motion to my Pen. I beſeech all ſuch who perhaps may wonder at the unſuitableneſſe of the title (which this Treatiſe ſeemeth to beare, with the condition of the Author) not to reflect upon the Writer, but to conſider what he writes: ſince it were not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Artificers name ſhould by way of prejudice bring disfavour or diſgrace upon his worke. Beſides, (the cauſe being more nearely examined) there will not appeare any ſo great diſproportion betweene them, as is ſuppoſed. For not to alledge that the treating of Policy appertaineth to the Civil-Lawyer, is permitted to the Philoſopher, and is not inconvenient for the Divine, who contemplateth the primary cauſe, as it is the rule and meaſure of all things, I will onely in generall affirme, that the Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Vniverſall conſideration of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13114:14"/>whether Politicke Oeconomicall or particular, to be both honeſt and profitable to all men who have the faculty eyther to argue, or diſcourſe: though the practicall part of the Politicke appertayneth onely to thoſe, who beſides knowledge have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, practice and experience.

Now if the eſtabliſhment of Graces be the Maſter-peece of humane induſtry, doubtleſſe the right and juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof may well be accounted the moſt exact proofe of humane wiſdome.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13114:15"/>As Gods providence appearing in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conduct even of leaſt matters, ſhineth yet moſt gloriouſly in the univerſall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Vniverſe: ſo humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhewing it ſelfe in the right ordering of our private actions, is yet more perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the government of a Family, but of greateſt luſter in the exact direction of the generall body of Civill ſocietie. For good is alwayes by ſo much the more eminent, by how much it is more capable to extend and diffuſe it ſelfe. Corporall things do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhew us this ground; that the ſight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt to extend it ſelfe to moſt objects, is the ſharpeſt. That hand to be the ſtrongeſt, which throweth the fartheſt. That taſte to be the beſt tempered which can diſtinctly diſcover the difference of moſt reliſhes. That fire to be moſt active, that is able not onely to conſume wood and ſtone, but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo though its contrary, as it is ſayd of the fire of Thunder; And that light to be moſt lively and cleare, which doth moſt communicate it ſelfe. Briefly, all corporeall things of greateſt extent in their action, are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13114:16"/>likewiſe of moſt vigour in their nature. The like may be obſerved in ſpirituall matters: ſince that Vnderſtanding which pierceth the pith of moſt truthes is moſt ſolid. That Memory ſtrongeſt, which conſerveth moſt ſpecies. That Iudgement of moſt capacity which is moſt univerſall. That Wiſedome greateſt which apprehendeth moſt reaſons. And that Prudence moſt divine which can dexteriouſly manage greateſt affaires. The vertue therefore which employeth it ſelfe in the conduct of a private life onely, is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to that which reflects upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of many: but that which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh publique rule, ought to exceed all the reſt, and to have ſo much the more abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as it ought, the farther to extend it's acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But to handle this ſubject with more order and perſpicuity, before I proceed, I intend to frame and lay for a Baſis and foundation of all this diſcourſe, a generall diviſion of Politicall vertue divided into three members or parts, which as with three ſeverall ſtages ſhall perfect this little fabrick. Thoſe three members are three rankes or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13114:16"/>orders of qualities requiſite to perfectionate Politicall vertue. The firſt affordeth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and capacity; the ſecond a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and honeſty; the third vigour and gracefulneſſe. Thoſe of the firſt ranke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Vnderſtanding to know what is convenient for the publike good. Thoſe of the ſecond, diſpoſe the will to deſire, love, and ſearch the knowne good. Thoſe of the laſt, adde force and efficacy to be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute, and produce to the Worlds eye, the good we know, will, and love. To know, to will, and to effect good, are the three perfections of God the worlds moover and governour; ſo as among men, who ſo hath the greateſt ſhare in theſe three perfections commeth neareſt God, and is moſt worthy, as moſt capable to afford (by his counſels) motion to the authority which ſwayeth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. Wiſedome, Prudence, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues thereon depending, making a man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and capable; thereby acquireth to him the firſt of theſe three perfections: Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and her aſſiſtant vertues, making him good and upright, affordeth him the ſecond:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13114:17"/>Authoritie, ſucceſſe, fortitude, courage and eloquence, arming and adorning him both for perſwading and executing good, addeth the laſt. Theſe three ſorts of qualities ſhall make up the three bookes of this Treatiſe. Let us begin with thoſe of the firſt ranke, and firſt with <hi>Wiſedome.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>VT Wiſdome (as ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Ethicks) being an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent knowledge of things, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of moſt high and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall matters; as it ought to be the Squire, the Rule, and Meaſure of the meaneſt and moſt particular affayres, (ſuch as thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily happening in civill affayres) ſo is it requiſite for the rayſing it ſelfe to a higher pitch, it be adorned with a capable ſpirit, a powerfull judgement, a ſtrong nature, a deeper ſtudy, and a very great experience, qualities (which though ſeparate) are not very ordinary, being united, are admirable. Nature without ſtudy, is by ſo much the more dangerous, by how much it is more violent; for as without husbandry the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any field ſerveth only to bring forth the more brambles, which choak the good ſeed; ſo without ſtudy, which cultivateth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13114:20"/>nature, the ſtrength of ſpirit ſerves only to produce the more violent paſſions, which darken reaſon, and hinder it from ſeeing cleare into affayres. It is true, experience and honeſty may in ſome ſort rectifie this fault, but never either ſufficiently, nor perfectly repayre it: for ſtill (without Science) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience remayneth blinde, honeſty feeble, and both of them faulty. Honeſty deſires good, but knowes it not, experience knows it, yet only by the events which are but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and daily changeable, and not by immoveable principles, univerſall, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable to all occurrents, ſo as experience without ſcience, walketh ſtill either fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or raſhly; but knowledge ſeeing all things in their ſourſes and infallible cauſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth nature, guideth honeſty, lightneth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and cauſeth it to march confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon all occaſions, to the end it bee not timerous, and underſtandingly, leſt it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, ſtudy without a ſtrong nature, is rather chargeable than uſefull, as ſolid meates to a ſickly ſtomack, oppreſſing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13114:20"/>it with his ponderoſity, inſtead of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by naturall digeſtion; and in truth, wits for the moſt part reſemble ſeverall ſoyles, the ſtrong beare good corne, weake earth either choakes the graine, or change it into cockle. A good naturall wit and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy matching together, open the paſſage to high employments. But before exerciſe have put them into practice, they are as tooles in the hand, or reaſons in the thoughts of a workman, who hath Art, but no pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; ſo as without experience theſe two qualities, though right commendable, are not yet ſufficient to frame what is tearmed wiſdome, being an excellency in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things. One attayneth the Art of Fencing upon the Theater, Limming upon the Picture, and (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth) the Potters Art is finiſhed upon his earthen ware. A good naturall wit diſpoſeth ſtudy, formeth experience, perfecteth man, and theſe three parts happily united, make up a right wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, requiſite for the conduct of weighty affayres. And as three things are fitting for tillage, fertillity, of ſoyle goodneſſe of ſeed,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13114:21"/>&amp; the husbandmans induſtry, ſo (in point of our ſubject) theſe three peeces are neceſſary; a good wit, a better inſtruction, and Art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by uſe. Wherefore it is, that in a well ordered warre, ſouldiers are never rayſed to the higheſt ranks, before they have paſſed thorow the meaneſt offices, to the end that having learned this exerciſe in inferiour charges, they may come thorowly inſtructed to more important places: So likewiſe in well policed States, higheſt dignities are never conferred, but upon ſuch who have gayned experience in meaner offices. The ancient Romans mounted not at once to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, but by degrees, as by the Oedility, the Tribunat, the Pontificat, theſe being the ſteps whereby they aſcended, and as ſchooles of honour where thoſe were framed for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, whom they after intended to make capable for the government of ſo mighty a Republique. The faults of Potters who work only on clay and ſand, are not greatly hurtfull; but thoſe of the Phyſitians, who exerciſe their Art upon the bodies of men, are pernicious, and utterly irreparable. They
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13114:21"/>learne to our great dangers (ſaith an antient Author very elegantly) they make their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by our deaths, and their prentiſhip breaketh no pots, but coſt mens lives. In petty places, faults are not heavy, but may eaſily be reformed. In eminent offices, they are of farther conſideration, and often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedie. There is no failing there the ſecond time, the firſt errour is irremediable; wherefore the well ordered Policie ought to imitate Nature, which (in her operations) worketh ſlowly, and ſtep by ſtep, cauſing the blade to come from the graine, the tree from the graft, from the tree, the bloſſom, and from bloſſomes, fruit; ſo ought Policie to raiſe great perſons from one degree to another, to the end that having made their aſſayes in meaner matters, they may finiſh their maſter-pieces in more eminent affairs; as Gold-ſmiths who make tryall of their skill upon Tinne, or Silver, before they worke in gold or pretious ſtones.</p>

Now it is a certaine and a generally receiued maxime among the wiſe: that all the uniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iall and generall propenſions in Nature, came from God. It is an uniuerſall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in humane Nature, to be ſubject to ſome one for maintenance of order and ſocietie. Conduct preſuppoſeth the authority giuen to that man who is conſtituted for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of others, ſo as by neceſſarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, temporall power is derived from God: ſince it proceedeth by the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the law of Nature. This natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall demonſtration is confirmed by divine authoritie: <hi>There is no power which proceedeth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13114:26"/>not from God,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> God himſelfe in the Creation framed not many men at once who might the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner haee ſtored the earth: he made but one man onely: yea, ſo as that he made not man and woman together of earth, but firſt drew man from the earth, and extracted woman from man, to ſhew (as St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> divinely noteth) how his intention was to eſtabliſh Domination, Principalitie, and Monarchy among men, and to reduce them all under one ſuperiour, cauſing them all to proceed from one onely, to the end all might depend upon him. He then hath at all times inſtituted temporall Princes over his choſen people; firſt Patriarches, then Dukes, (after this) Iudges, and in concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kings: his providence concluding in Monarchie as the moſt perfect forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; As Nature which proceedeth by degrees in her works; firſt maketh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury out of the vapours of the earth, after, out of Mercury, Silver, and out of ſilver, Gold; (the Crowne and perfection of all Mettals:) ſo IEVS CHRIST comming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13114:27"/>into the world, hath (by his word) confirmed temporall authoritie, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> what is due to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and the Apoſtle enjoyneth us under paine of eternall damnation to yeeld to our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Soveraignes, obedience, tribute, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, honour, and our prayers tribute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he defends our lives and goods from violence, Obedience, ſince he deriveth his power from God; Reſpect, in that he is his Miniſter; Honour, by reaſon hee beareth his Image; Prayers in reflection upon the great need he hath of Gods aſſiſtance in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending us.

                  <p>If then, both Nature, Reaſon, and the Evanglicall law, ſhew us ſo apparantly, how God hath eſtabliſhed all States, doth both defend, maintaine, and hath ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care over them: Is it not reaſon all States ſhould range themſelves to the rule of

Since the power of thoſe who governe States is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God, it is neceſſary that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which directeth this power ſhould be deduced from the Law of God.

                  <p>If the order we obſerve in the words contexture hath taught Philoſophers (as the Apoſtle ſayth to the <hi>Romans</hi>) the guidance of a Soveraigne wiſedome, I ſuppoſe the ſo admirable order diſcovered in States, and Common-wealthes doth no leſſe declare the ſame; And if the harmony reſulting in Nature out of the contrariety of Sphericall motions; from the quality of the Elements, and Elementarie bodyes, cannot otherwiſe proceed but from the direction of a ſupream wiſdome; the peace and concord ariſing in the regulating of ſo great a diverſity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, affections, oppoſitions rancounters, events, and changes, can no way proceed from any meaner conduct. All whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, greatneſſe, power, lawes, menaces, feare, recompences, penalties, and what elſe the inventions of humane wiſdome (out of God) are able to exact, or draw from men by force, or win of them by a ſweet hand, is but conſtrained not voluntarie; painted,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13114:29"/>not pure; fraile, not permanent; The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man is ſo noble and generous, as there is none but God onely who can truly ſubject the ſame. <hi>Make thy ſelfe</hi> (ſayth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) <hi>a Law-maker over men to the end they may know they are men.</hi> It is God alone who is able to humiliate the ſpirit of man, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate his ſterneneſſe, tame his heart, and cauſe him to acknowledge his condition, and the reſpect he oweth thoſe he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over others; who hold his place, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his perſon, and beare his Image. The true Wiſdome (therefore) of ſuch who by their counſels give incitation to Princes, and by Princes to ſeverall States, is to take their motion from God, their rule from his will, and their counſell from his word, as (in truth) there is neyther true counſell, nor true light, ſave that onely which (as the Apoſtle Saint IAMES ſayth) floweth from the Father of light. <hi>All wiſdome deriveth it ſelfe from God,</hi> ſayth the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Heaven is the Author of all, both corporal and ſpirituall light, the Sun is the light of

Now ſince (according to Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Maxims) one cannot deliver an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red judgement of things, but in conſidering the reference, relation, and connexion they have with primary cauſes: God (therefore) who is this firſt cauſe, ought to be the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary object, and principall rule of all our judgements and counſels, if we deſire to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our judgements from error, and our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13114:31"/>counſels from temeritie. So whatſoever men have at any time eſtabliſhed of good, or juſt in temporall lawes, eyther imprinted in them by Nature, or deduced by Reaſon, or knowne by inſpiration, or manifeſted by revelation; if it ſtray from this principle, it is unjuſt; and what is unjuſt is violent; and what is violent cannot challenge the name of law Whereupon St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his book of <hi>True Religion,</hi> delivereth this advice and inſtruction to Stateſ-men: <hi>The man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who counſelleth, propoſeth, or eſtabliſheth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Lawes, if he be an honest man, and a just, he first takes councel of the Eternall Lawes:</hi> wherof it is unlawfull for any man to judge, all men being injoyned to follow the ſame, <hi>to the end, that according to theſe immutable rules, he may ſee what he ought (conſidering the diſpoſitions and neceſsities of times) either to command or prohibit.</hi> An advice drawne from the commandement God made to the Kings and Iudges of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to have at all times his law before their eyes, by reading, and in their hearts by meditation. As King <hi>David</hi> who ſayd unto God. <hi>Thy Word is as

                  <p>This is the ſolid ground of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent commendations we can give to the truly wiſe <hi>Politician,</hi> who over and above the naturall capacitie of ſpirit, and of human wiſdome acquired by ſtudy, and experience of affaires, addeth divine knowledge which he taketh as the principall guide of all his motions, reaſons, maxims, counſels, decrees, and actions; he doth not as the <hi>Lesbian</hi> buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh, who fitteth the Squire, or Ruler to the Stones; as they doe who ſeeke to accommodate God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and Iuſtice to times: but he fitteth and faſhions the ſtones to the Squire or Ruler, affaires to God, and the times to Iuſtice. He imitateth good Pilots, who holding the hand on the helme, lift their eyes to heaven, to receive from the Pole the conduct of their Ships: ſo whilſt he manageth the ſteering of civill affaires, he hath his eyes fixed on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall verities, &amp; upon the divine law, whence he taketh his directions. And as the High-Prieſt of the old law, drew the anſwers and Oracles he delivered to the people, from a

For as the corporall eye ſeeth not the objects touching it, but thoſe onely more remote: ſo the underſtanding continually plunged in affayres, is not ſo quicke-ſighted in occurrents, as his who ſometimes retireth himſelfe from publike action, beholding it aloofe off by conſideration: As it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how the noyſe which the waters of <hi>Nile</hi> make, do cauſe all thoſe who liveneere the fals or Cataracts to become deafe; Or as the Roman Oratour in his booke <hi>of the dreames of Scipio,</hi> was of opinion, that the harmonious and muſicall ſound, reſulting from the divers motions of the celeſtiall Spheres, is not by us underſtood, by reaſon the ſound is ſo ſtrong, ſo quicke and violent, that our eares are thereby deafned; Or as they who nouriſh ſilk-wormes, hinder thoſe

Beſides, experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, that the eye having loſt its quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with too much looking upon the light, recovers it againe in the darke: The ſpirit in like manner, dazled, weakened, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted among the multitude, and variety of affaires, ought to recollect and recover its force in the privacie of ſome ſmall retreit. Moreover, ſee you not how the vapours ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the earth, darken the Sun-light, and would utterly over-cloud it, did not the Sun recollecting its vigour, at length diſſipat them by the point of his beames? In like manner, worldly affaires ſend forth certain miſts, invironing the interiour eye, where the light of wiſedome reſideth, and by litle and litle coveting the ſoule with darkeneſſe, tranſports it to inconſideration, and from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13114:34"/>thence to a thouſand ſtumbling blocks, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it to retire with ſhame, if the ſoule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting this danger, did not now and then recollect it ſelfe, and by the attentive conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of its eſtate, duty, and end, cauſe it to diſperſe thoſe clouds which darken rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

For whence ariſe ſo many miſchiefes, ruines, and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, be it is in families, Cities, or Eſtates, but only out of the want of wiſdome among men, and whence this, but from the defect of conſideration? It is a thing naturall; that as a ſtone caſt into a calme and ſetled water, cauſeth there a circle, this circle a ſecond, the ſecond a third, this third maketh a fourth; Circle, after circle, till the water from one ſide to the other be all troubled: ſo worldly

The Philoſopher in his Ethicks,<note place="margin">Ariſt. l. <hi>6.</hi> Eth.</note> aſſigneth five kinds of intellectuall vertues, the Intellect, Science, Wiſdome, Art, and Prudence. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect is no other than the habitude and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to know the primary principles, which are perceived by themſelves, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently apprehended by the intellectuall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13114:37"/>power without the aſſiſtance of ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Science is a demonſtrative habitude of neceſſarie things which cannot otherwiſe be, and this habitude is acquired by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Reaſon, ſounding and ſearching the cauſes, thereby to know the effects: Now this knowledge of effects by the cauſes is called Science. Wiſdome is a very perfect and exact Science, knowing both the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences deduced from the principles, and the principles themſelves with the moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall cauſes: ſo (according to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher) the excellent knowledge of every Science, Diſcipline, and Art may be called Wiſdome. Art is an habitude and juſt reaſon of certaine workemanſhips which are to be made, and produced to the ſhew, as building and painting, with the like. Art reflecteth not upon the interiour reſiding in the ſoule, but on the action paſſing and flowing from the interiour underſtanding to imprint it ſelfe upon exteriour ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Prudence is a juſt reaſon of the actions of human life, and of what man ought to doe and practice, according to his eſtate and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13114:38"/>condition. Now of theſe five habitudes or vertues which inſtruct and perfectionate the intellective power, Art ſuteth not with our ſubject: The Intellect and Science have bin curſorily touched, when I ſayd; that a good wit, and the ſtudy of Letters were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite as neceſſary parts for the forming of Wiſdome. There now remaineth onely <hi>Prudence:</hi> which being the right rule of of human actions, is as it were the ſoule and life of the active, civill, and Politicke life. For Intellect, Science, and Wiſdome, are onely ſerviceable for the underſtanding the univerſall reaſons of things, and the true ends whereto they are to be referred.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rudence (as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſayth in his Ethicks) regardeth (as its object) things either good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, profitable or perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, honeſt or reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a man, following his calling and charge, and it is proper to the prudent to conſult, and ſolidly to adviſe with himſelfe in each affaire, and particular action, what is fitting and convenient to the preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to his duty, ranke, and office. So as (to ſay truly) looke how requiſite Art is for the workes of induſtry, ſo fitting is Prudence for the affaires of vertue. An ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour termeth Prudence, the Art of living; Now to live as a man ought, is to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reaſon. A man without Prudence, is as a workeman without Art, who hath
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13114:40"/>tooles in his hand, but wanteth act to make right uſe of them for the impreſſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient formes in the matter whereon he is to worke. Man likewiſe who hath Science and VViſdome without Prudence, ſeeth well the Reaſons, and the end whereto he is to ayme, but is deſtitute of the right appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of reaſons, whereby to finde out the meanes, and attaine to the end; And as the unkilfull craftſ-man ſpoyles the matter thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to poliſh it: So the imprudent man ruines affaires preſuming to rectifie them; nor is there other difference, ſave onely that the former ſpoyles Iron, ſtones, wood, or ſome other matters of ſlight conſideration, the other ruines himſelfe, his particular for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, yea whole States and Empires if he have thereof the adminiſtration.

For as wiſdome is the eye of ſpeculative life: ſo is Prudence the light of practicall Reaſon; and as without the light of wiſdome, the underſtanding erreth in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13114:41"/>the knowledge of truth: ſo without the light of Prudence, it cannot but erre in the conduct of actions. It is the firſt office of Prudence to ſee what is to be done in the occurrence and circumſtance of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe, then to finde out the meanes of compaſſing them, this being done, then to preſcribe the meaſure, and limits of the action; ſince (as the Philoſopher ſayth) it appertayneth to Prudence to allot a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite medium to all vertues; having waighed what is fitting for time, place, ſubject, and affaires; after, to gaine the dexterity of attayning thereto, and to preſcribe the meaſure he therein ought to obſerve: his laſt office is to put commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in action by prompt and diligent exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, by meanes of the ſoules faculty, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the charge of executing the ſentence of judgement, and the Empire of Reaſon. Now if any one of theſe foure parts of Prudence, eyther counſell, meanes, meaſure, or prompt commandement bee defective in action; how can it merit the title or glory of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous worke? If counſell fayle him,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13114:42"/>it is fooliſh; if it want meanes, it is vaine; if meaſure, it is irregular; if prompt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune execution, it is idle; unuſefull; fruitleſſe. If fooliſh, how can it beright? If vaine, how good? If irregular, how ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous? If idle, how laudable? VVherefore, as Queenes and great rinceſſes, are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by along traine of Ladyes of Honour: ſo Prudence (as Queen of vertues) is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by foure other vertues: The firſt is called <hi>Eubulia;</hi> well to conſult of whatſoever is to be effected, to examine and ponder what is neceſſary for the well ordering of actions in all ſorts of affayres. The ſecond carryes the name of <hi>Syneſis;</hi> a vertue requiſite to judge aright and to draw ſolid concluſions our of the principles of the univerſall Law. The third is called <hi>Gnomè,</hi> well to examine in particular what is to be done according to naturall reaſon, when there is (in ſome caſe) no expreſſe law. The laſt likewiſe is named <hi>Gnomè</hi> to reſolve and command after due reſearch and judgement. There are three acts of Reaſon, which reflect upon humane actions to conſult, judge, and command. And
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13114:42"/>to the end this may paſſe in due place, and conformably to reaſon; It is neceſſary that Prudence be accompanyed with theſe foure vertues; the firſt whereof ſerves for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, the ſecond and third for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the laſt for commandement.</p>

There are three ſorts of Prudence, as there are three generall conditions of mans life: For
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13114:43"/>eyther man hath onely charge of himſelfe, and hath therefore need onely of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prudence, or he hath moreover the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a family requiring an oeconomicall Prudence; or elſe the adminiſtration of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like aſſayres, which requireth a Civill and Politike Prudence. Now if common Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (neceſſary onely for particulars) be ſo rare among men, the oeconomicall and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike is farre more extraordinary; and if the right and Prudent conduct of our ſelves, requires ſuch parts; what ſhall we ſay of the conduct of others? Of the guidance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publikes and government of Empires? The Scripture ſayes: <hi>That God founded Heaven by Prudence:</hi> and the Philoſopher: <hi>That this is the proper vertue for him who governes and proceeds:</hi> not that it is not neceſſary for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, but that it is in ſuch ſort requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for him who hath publike charge: that as light is to the Sun, and heat to the fire; ſo this to him is a proper eſſence and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quality; without which he is no more capable to manage affaires, than the Pilot is to guide a Ship without the Helme and Sea-Card.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13114:43"/>God having choſen <hi>loſyph</hi> to govern the State of Egypt under King <hi>Pharath,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued him with ſo perfect a prudence, as (though yong) yet was hee able to inſtruct the Antients.

And truely ſince Prudence is the right rule of ſuch things as we ought to execute (the whole life of publique perſons conſiſting in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and practice) they cannot eſcape from falling into manifold errors, if they be not adorned with much Prudence. And ſince this vertue, as the watching and open eye over the ſcepter of the Egyptians, ought to ſpreade its circumſpection on every ſide, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver places, times, perſons, humours, appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, accidents, and dependencies; over things paſt, preſent, and future; over rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, conjectures, ſuſpitions, briefly over the ſmalleſt particularities hapning in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the oppoſitions rancounters and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cties

Is not God the finall end of States in generall, as well of men in particular? if he be their end, ought he not to be their ayme? if their ayme, ought they not to levell thereat by meanes conduceable to their end? What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes are proper to cauſe all States to tend toward God, than thoſe which the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence derived from God dictates unto us?

Wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> called the people of <hi>Jſrael,</hi> who would not guide themſelves according to Gods law, but by their private ſpirit, a Nation without Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and Prudence.

From thence it is we ſee occaſions of heroick acts of temperance in ſcorne of dignities, and honours to proceede. Acts which crowne their Author with immortall honour, and fill theſe with confuſion, whom they cannot draw to imitation.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13114:51"/>deceitfull; and Prudence in a diſſembling one, malitious. It is as the Peach-tree, which receiving the qualitie of the ſoyle where it is planted; in <hi>Perſia</hi> is poyſonous, elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where nutrimentall. It is the Camelion, which taking its tincture from the objects neareſt unto it, being neare clay, appeareth of a muddy colour, neare gold, of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hew, neare filth, of a foule colour; neare a Diamond, it caſteth the luſtre of a pretious ſtone So the will imprinteth the qualitie, the die and colour in the action, either good if it be ſincere, or evill if it be pernicious.</p>
                  <p>For there is this difference betweene the workes of injuſtice, and the actions of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that in the former there is no regard but onely to the dexterity; in the latter, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans honeſty is conſidered, there, the hand, and art performe all; here, the heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention have the greater ſhare. So as if the heart be not good, the intention upright, and the end lawfull, the worke cannot be exemplarie, though it appeare excellent. If the Architect build a faire houſe for a foule end, his irregular intention diſgraceth not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13114:52"/>his skill: but if he who produceth an act of vertue, propoſe to himſelf an unjuſt end, his intention depraveth his action, and the wicked quality of his heart deriveth it ſelfe into his worke. A fault (as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) which hath blemiſhed the moſt beautifull actions of morall vertues, appearing among the antient Ethnickes: who have propoſed to themſelves for the end of their actions, not (purely) juſtice, but ſome of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, others revenge, ſome delight, and the moſt vertuous among them, ambition and vanity. The heart being the beginning of naturall life, is likewiſe the principle of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in morall life; nor is there any other difference, ſave onely that in the body it dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth laſt, and in matter of vertue, the firſt. For in the body, all other parts dye, before the heart wholly decay; but in the matter of vertue, ſo long as the heart remaineth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, whileſt the intention continues ſound, and the will ſincere, all the actions are vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, good, and laudable; yea and thoſe which in regard they were vitious in their ſubjects, could not merit glory, being vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13114:52"/>in their concluſion, are yet worthy of excuſe. But the heart of vertue once dead, the intention perverted, and the will corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all is rotten, and the moſt faire vertues become infamous vices, and the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious acts puniſhable crimes. This is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of this ſacred word in the Goſpell: <hi>From the heart iſſueth all evill.</hi>

But if he be endued with reaſon, he over-ruleth all; and if with juſtice, he deſerves to command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all.

In briefe, Iuſtice is the rampart of his ſtrong places, the Bulwarke of his Cities, the prop of his Crowne: the mother of equality, the cement of union, the pillar of authority, and the eye of obedience. Our King, touched with theſe conſiderations, and inſpired from heaven, as <hi>Salomon</hi> in his tender yeares, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the importance of his charge, and weight of his Scepter, hath addreſſed the like prayer to Almighty God, exhibiting the ſame demand, as <hi>Salomon</hi> did in a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable neceſſity:<note place="margin">1 Reg. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord, thou haſt made mee to raigne in the place of my Father, thou haſt placed me in the midſt of a people which thou haſt choſen, amidſt an infinite people, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whereof paſſeth all that can be counted: Give then to thy ſervant a docible ſpirit, to the end that diſcerning good from evill, hee may iudge the people with iuſtice and equity.</hi> This is the prayer he made to God, and the grace hee demanded from heaven in his tender years, as did <hi>Salomon,</hi> requiring (as he did) not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, not proſperity, not victories, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, but onely wiſedome and juſtice.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13114:61"/>Now if this prayer of <hi>Salomon</hi> were ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, as hee not onely granted him what he demanded, but further added what he required not: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>thou haſt not demanded a long life, nor the death of thine enemies, nor abundance of treaſure, but rather wiſedome to diſcerne iudgement, and afford iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; behold, I have agreed to thy deſires, and have given thee a wiſe and intelligent heart, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo farre forth, that times paſt have not yet ſeene the like, nor ſhall future ages ever behold: but for an over-plus of my favours, I will give thee what thou haſt not as yet asked, abundance of riches, and the greatneſſe of a glory, which ſhall ſurpaſſe that of all thy predeceſſors.</hi> If God recompenced the holy and juſt deſire of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> with ſo many graces, ſhall we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he will now be leſſe liberall to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of Saint <hi>Louis,</hi> bearing his name, and walking in the ſteps of his vertues? or that he will not grant to the like prayers, the ſame graces? to the ſame vowes, the like gifts? to an equall diſpoſition, equall benedictions?

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13114:64"/>invincible arme ſuppreſſed the Hydra of our civill warres with more than an hundred heads, could not yet ſubdue this furious monſter of Duels, either by his Edicts or authority: he had diſſipated the ſtormes of our ſeditions, lockt up warre with iron chaines, placed peace upon pillars of braſſe; yet amongſt all theſe ſweets of peace, this unchained fury of Duels, robbing <hi>France</hi> of her moſt valiant children, ſtill afflicted her with more fatall effects of ſo bloudy a warre. She lamented her daily loſſes, and ſo many remedies uneffectually employed, cauſed her to feare leſt this miſchiefe were incurable. When behold, her <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſtanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as a Iaſper ſent from heaven) by his ſageneſſe and prudence, the bloud this fury drew from the veines of his moſt noble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, hath ſuddenly ſtopped her teares and griefes. And as <hi>Fortune</hi> heretofore ſtayed the Conqueſts of <hi>Philip,</hi> to the end his ſonne <hi>Alexander</hi> might finde ſubject to ſhew his valour, ſo ſeemeth it, that heaven limiting the good fortunes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, by the defeat of the Hydras of our ſeditions, hath
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13114:64"/>purpoſely refuſed him the victory over this monſter of Duels, to reſerve it for our <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and thereby to ſhare betweene the Fathers valour, and the Sonnes Iuſtice, the glory of the entire quiet, and ſafety of <hi>France.</hi> Thou oweſt (O <hi>France</hi>) the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy good fortune, to the Fathers armes, the perfection to the Sonnes lawes. The one <hi>(Great)</hi> hath raiſed thee, the other <hi>(Iuſt)</hi> hath confirmed thee, the one by bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, hath layd the plat-forme of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment, the other by his ordinances doth daily build and perfect thee. The one by his victories hath cured the wounds of warre, the other by his prudence, that of Duels, which ſtill continued bleeding in thy body. Thou now ſeeſt that accompliſhed, which wanting to thy wiſhes, ſeemed to be deficient to thy good fortune; this rage is layd aſleepe, not without aſtoniſhment; this fury extinguiſhed not without admiration: the bloud diſtilling from thy veines by this channell is now happily ſtayed: This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bloud formerly ſhed to thy loſſe, is now happily reſerved for thy defence. Nor haſt

It is reported, how neither prohibitions, nor menaces of lawes, could at all ſtay the fury of the Mileſian Virgins, immolating themſelves by a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy death, till the infamie of being expoſed naked after their death, cured their ſpirits of this frenzie, ſhame gaining that of them, which feare could not effect. So, ſince Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els have not (at Court) found this vaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, ſerving as a ſpurre and object to their ſavage ambition; and that our King is not ſatisfied in the onely proſecution of them by his Edicts, but hath farther purſued them even to his <hi>Louure,</hi> by hiſſings and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; his Royall diſcretion hath thereby found the true remedy againſt this blinde paſſion, which obſtinating it ſelfe againſt the terrour of all torments, could be onely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the apprehenſion of this diſgrace.

So as that Politicke Iuſtice, whereof we ſpeake, doth firſt of all produce from its ſtocke, three great branches, to wit, theſe three generall duties, the firſt toward God, the ſecond toward our ſelves, the third toward the publike: theſe three bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, doe after each of them ſhoot forth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſmall twigs, namely the particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to each one of theſe three, whereto Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice obligeth the Politician. Our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God produceth two: Religion with piety, and the right intention in counſels and

All waters come from the Sea, and returne thither; all power, all authority and ſuperiority comes from God, and ought to returne to him. It comes from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13114:69"/>God by extraction, it ſhould therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from us to God by homage: if the motive of acknowledgment and duty have no leſſe power over men, than Nature hath over-things inanimate. We ſee even among men, that thoſe who have not their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by extraction, but hold them of others, as from a Prince or King, are obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in humiliation and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment toward their ſuperiour, as they riſe in greatneſſe and authority over others: for ſhould they (as <hi>Sejanus</hi>) pervert their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters beneficence into matter of ſlighting, pride and rebellion, they would thereby convert their exaltation into occaſion of ruine. So the great ones of this world, who hold their dignities not of nature making all men equall, but of the will, providence, and ordinance of God, which hath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them into divers rankes; as they are more obliged to God than all other men; ſo ought they be more humble, gratefull, and religious toward God than others; and by how much the more his favour exalteth them, by ſo much the more ſhould the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration

See we not, that the farther a tree ſhooteth up his branches toward hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the lower it ſinkes its root into the earth? the higher a houſe is, the deeper is the foundation; and the wonder herein is, that its profundity ſupports it ſublimity, and the ſublimity would become its ruine, were not the depth of the foundation its firmeſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. Is not this an inſtruction to the great men of this world, that they ſhould abaſe themſelves by homage, Religion, and piety towards God, in proportion as God raiſeth them in authority over men: and if the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of this acknowledgement be not the foundation, and ſupport of their greatneſſe, their owne pride will be their deſtruction. <hi>God will debaſe thee</hi> (ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> to King <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer,</hi> who would not acknowledge God, but rather ſeeke to make himſelfe God) <hi>God will debaſe thee even ſo farre, as thou ſhalt learne, that the moſt high hath dominion over the raigne of men.</hi> The Angels of the higheſt order are moſt obedient to God, moſt prompt to execute his will, and who more

We ſhall on the contrary ſide obſerve, that the piety of Princes hath cauſed their eſtates to flouriſh, and their

Yet would God ſhew by theſe examples, that (in conſequence of his promiſe) when we firſt ſeeke his Kingdome, his juſtice, and the obſervation of his lawes, temporall bleſſings are further added, as by acceſſary and dependant rights.</p>
                  <p>But that which ſhould further incite thoſe who have the government of States, to a higher ſtraine of Religion and piety towards God, than ordinary perſons, is the greateſt need they have more than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of his illumination in their counſels, of his conduct in their enterpriſes, of his force in their executions, and of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care in their various occurrents, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

                  <p>But is it not apparant, that thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt pious and religious towards God, are the beſt diſpoſed ſubjects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe ſpirituall endowments, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the high attempts of generous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? <hi>Vpon whom ſhall my ſpirit deſcend,</hi> (ſaith God by the Prophet) <hi>but upon him who hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelfe before my face, and who feareth my words?</hi> The feare of God, daughter of true piety, is one of thoſe gifts of the holy

                  <p>Examine Hiſtory, and ye ſhall finde, that they who have had piety and the feare of God engrafted in their ſoules, are the men who have produced the braveſt acts, both of Magnanimity, Conſtancy, Wiſedome, Prudence, Valour, and Counſell, as well in warre as peace: nor have they been weake in any thing, ſave onely in iniquity, a thing wherein the world ſo much ſheweth its ſtrength.

To this purpoſe we reade in our Hiſtories, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> after ſo many battels, victories, and triumphs, which crowned him with immortall honour, applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe yet daily more and more to piety, to the exaltation of Religion, to the foundation, enrichment, and adornement of Churches: certaine Stateſ-men intimated unto him (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of publike good) that ſo great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralities exhauſted his treaſure, and that he might employ this beneficence, both to better purpoſe, and with greater glory to himſelfe, in advancing the poore families
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13114:73"/>of ſouldiers, and gentry, then in adding more to the riches of Churches and Altars. Yee then wonder (anſwered this wiſe King) at what I doe for the worſhip of God: but if you reflected upon the frequent neceſſities and perplexities wherein wee have beene formerly plunged in our warres and battels, and out of which the mercifull hand of the Almighty hath a thouſand times viſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and ſaved us, beyond all humane reaſon and likelihood, having wrought ſo great things both for the ſafety of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the glory of our State: yee would finde no exceſſe, but rather a defect in what I doe for his ſervice.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt ſince Religion ought not to be vaine, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes, nor piety a tree without fruit; the fruits therefore of piety fit for a right Politician, are zeale towards the worſhip of God, obedience to his ordinances, reverence towards his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, reſpect to his miniſters, and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Church. God hath placed in heaven (ſaith an holy Father) two great lights, the Sunne and Moone; and on earth two ſoveraigne powers; the ſpirituall and temporall: but as in the heavens, the Moon borrowes her light from the Sunne; ſo on earth the temporall ought to receive from
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13114:74"/>the ſpirituall, the light of true wiſedome, neceſſary for its guidance. The law of God, which the Church propoſeth and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, ought to regulate the world; the light of God which this Sun diſtributeth, ought to illuminate it; It goeth aſtray if it follow not this light, and it loſeth this light if it turne the backe from this Sunne.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He integrity of intention in counſels and actions, is the other dutie of Politicke Iuſtice towards God. For it is a quality requiſite in every juſt and honeſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as the forme which gives being to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall honeſty: but the intention cannot bee ſincere, but by relation of the action to the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13114:74"/>true end of man, which is God. So as the action cannot be good and juſt if it tend not to God, either by the hearts intention, or at leaſt by the nature of the worke, which of it ſelfe hath relation to God, by meanes of the beauty of that object it reflecteth on. And in this ſenſe, all the excellent actions of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Infidels, performed for the beauty of vertue, not for vanity, profit, venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and other vitious and irregular ends and affections; had of themſelves a kinde of relation to God, though man be not aware thereof: Nay, it is moreover the opinion of the moſt learned Divines, that theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (by their condition) appertaine to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reward, though the hindrance of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity cauſeth them to faile in the attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For whatſoever is effected (purely) for a vertuous end, is good; what is good, is gracious in Gods ſight; that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to God, is conformable to his will, either revealed unto us by his law, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in us by nature; and whatſoever is ſutable to his will, belongeth to life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting: ſince the Scripture ſaith: <hi>That life is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13114:75"/>found in the obſervation of his will:</hi> but each thing belonging to life everlaſting, is not ſufficiently availeable for the acquiſition thereof, if faith, charity, grace, and all other neceſſary qualities doe not concurre. Who knowes not that the faith of a Chriſtian dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſtate of grace, is notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a thing belonging to eternall life, in its owne nature: yet by reaſon of ſinne, though it appertaine thereto, it arriveth not thereto: As the childe who is debarred of his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inheritance to whom it belongeth, when at any time the right acquired by his origine, becommeth unprofitable unto him by his offence. So all good morall actions, have naturally right to the inheritance of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall felicity, which is mans laſt end; but they faile thereof through their default, when either ſinne, or infidelity maketh their former right unuſefull to them. Now this is ſufficient to ſhew, that all actions purely performed for a vertuous end, be they particular, acconomicall, or Politicall, levell and goe directly toward God, though man dream not at all of any relation to that end.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:13114:75"/>
                  <p>This foundation layd, I ſay, that to cauſe a Politicke action to become juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, it muſt be armed with a right intention, and which tendeth to God: if not by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe cogitation and ayme of the ſoule, yet at leaſt by the good and lawfull quality of the object. But the object is good, when it is conformable, either to naturall reaſon, being the unwritten law, or to Gods law, which is the written reaſon; or to juſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes, and thoſe not contrary to God and nature, which is Reaſon; explicated, enlarged, unfolded, and propoſed by thoſe who have authority, ſerving as a rule to all particular actions. Every maxime, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and action, being not ſquared, and added to one of theſe three Rules, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon no other thing, than either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, profit, ambition, or ſome other diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate paſſion: unlawfull objects, not being able to imprint in a morall act other than injuſtice and diſhoneſty.</p>
                  <p>All this doth punctually ſhew us, that it is an obligation in Politicke juſtice concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God to conforme, by a right intention,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13114:76"/>our propoſitions, counſels and actions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to naturall reaſon, or to divine law, or to juſt humane lawes, and by this meanes to cauſe the State to tend to God, which is the common end both of the Church and State, of ſpirituall and temporall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of body and ſoule. And truely ſince Iuſtice willeth us to afford to every man his due, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall States being of Gods inſtitution and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, Iuſtice commandeth us, that an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration conformable to his will, ſhould have relation to his glory. Thither it is all ought to ayme, namely amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who acknowledge whence they come, where they are, and whither they tend, as knowing their originall, their eſtate and end. The whole world is made for man, and man for God; now though he hath two diſtinct parts, the body and ſoule, two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent motions, one of reaſon, the other of appetite: and conſequently two ſeverall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, ſpirituall and temporall; yet ſo it is, that he hath but one onely finall end, which is the enjoyment of God. He is therefore obliged to cauſe all to ayme at God: body
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13114:76"/>and ſoule; reaſon and appetite; the ſpirituall and temporall: As the Prophet <hi>David</hi> who ſayd unto God: <hi>Both my ſoule and my fleſh thirſt after thee.</hi> All within mee, aſpireth to thee O Lord, my ſoule and the powers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, my fleſh with its dependencies, theſe two parts compoſing my all: though diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in nature, unite themſelves by affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having but one end, have likewiſe but one deſire, cauſing their divers moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to tend to the ſame Center. See here, that not onely the ſoule, but the body like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ought to ayme at Almighty God, who is the finall end, and will be the crowne of both: when after the reſurrection, the ſoule faelicitated by the viſion of the God-head, ſhall make the body happy by the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of her beatitude, ſo as both of them ſhall enjoy God: the ſoule by viſion, the body in its manner, by the ſenſibility of theſe ſweets: the ſoule by union, the fleſh by participation and ſociety: the ſoule by the intermiſe of the light of glory, the fleſh by the communication of the ſoules glory. So as if God be the end, the Crowne, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13114:77"/>the ſoveraigne good, not of the ſoule one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but likewiſe of the body. And if theſe two parts compoſing man, ought equally to ayme at God; is it not altogether neceſſarie, that Politicke power having charge to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect whatſoever belongeth to the body, ſhould propoſe God both for object and end, as well as the ſpirituall power, which governeth theſe things touching the ſoule? If the fleſh cauſe man to periſh, can the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſave him? If the temporall make him ſlip from God, the ſpirituall deſiring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to God, ſhall it not ſee it ſelfe fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of the deſired end? To undoe ones ſelfe on the one ſide, is no leſſe than to be loſt on both ſides: ſince the ſoule followes the body, the one part the other, and the whole the parts.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter we have given to God our ſincere Intentions, we after owe to our ſelves the care of a good name, which is neceſſary in a Magiſtrate, for profiting the publike, as the communication of the Suns light is for illuminating the world. <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> required this quality for thoſe he intended to place over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> and this point dependeth on the other: for as a ſtraight body caſteth an upright ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and a counterfeit one, a crooked: ſo commonly a good conſcience caſteth the ſhadow of a ſingular reputation, a wicked one, the ſhadow of a bad fame. And though the intention be a ſecret of the heart, not comming to ſight before the eyes of men;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13114:78"/>yet doth ſhee ſhout forth (as a hidden root) the fruits of ſuch actions, as diſcover the treee. <hi>Yee ſhall know them by their fruits:</hi> (ſaith truth it ſelfe.) It was no unfitting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, when the Ancients compared vertue to the body, and a good name to the ſhadow following the ſame. For as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy perſpicuated by the light, caſts a ſhadow, which may be called the daughter of light, and of the body: of light cauſing it by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring the body; and of the body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it by being reflected upon by the light; So vertue lightened by publike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, produceth reputation, which may be termed Ioynt-daughter to vertue, and acknowledgement, of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement which ſeeing vertue, takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, and of vertue which encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by acknowledgement, produceth it. So that as the ſhadow is the production of the body lightened, ſo honour is the childe of vertue acknowledged. But it happeneth that in the morning the Sunne reflecting a farre off upon the body, the ſhadow goes before; towards noone, beating plumme
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13114:78"/>upon it, the ſhadow walkes aſide by it; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening, leaving it behind, the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow followes it. The like it is in rare and eminent perſons: the firſt view of ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue, beginneth betimes to caſt before them the reputation which precedeth them, levelling the way for them to great actions. In the midſt of their courſe being expoſed perpendicularly to the eyes of all men, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry marcheth along by them; and afterward in the evening of their age, the certaine proofes they have ſhewed of their vertue and goodneſſe, goe before them as a cleare Sunne, to prepare for them a renown which ſhall follow them eternally in the memory of after-ages. Obſerve all the Ancients who have appeared upon the Theater of the moſt famous States, honour hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them at their entry, accompanied them in their courſe, and followed them after their death: honour hath beene the Herald, which marching before them, hath opened the way for them to great deſignes: honour hath beene their inſeparable convoy in the execution of their famous exploits: honour
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13114:79"/>hath moreover beene their immortall crowne after their deceaſe. And it is a touch of Gods divine Providence in the conduct of ſublunary States; ſo to governe thoſe whom he pleaſeth to make choice of as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his favours, and for the ſafety of Empires, as he cauſeth the glory of their vertue betimes to appeare amidſt the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of moſt corrupted ages, putting them into credit, in the midſt of diſorder, rayſing them in the middle of ingratitude, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them in the throng of envies, illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them among calumnies: affording them this honour not for a ſubject of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vanity, but for occaſion and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to imploy the vertue afforded them for publike utility, and after they have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves worthy cooperators with his Providence in ſo great a worke, hee for ever conſerveth the memory of theirnames, to the end their vertue having beene uſefull for the age they lived in, their example may ſerve for future times.</p>
                  <p>Good fame therefore is the inſeparable ſhadow of vertue in publike perſons; and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:13114:79"/>as Mathematicians meaſure the height of the body by the length of the ſhadow; and as the Ancients have diſcovered, (by the extent of the ſhadow of Mount <hi>Athos</hi>) the ſublimity of its eminent top; ſo ſhall we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be deceived in taking the modell of the vertues in eminent perſons, from the meaſure of their reputation. For it is a max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime verified by experience, that moſt men following the tide of naturall inclination, are more ſubject to ſcandaliſe, than praiſe; and if they erre in their judgements concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe who govern them, they are ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner tranſported to raſh cenſures, than to waine praiſes. The very ſhadow of one ſingle vice, ſufficeth to procure publike blame, a thouſand vertues being no more than neceſſary to acquire generall approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All men take notice of faults, few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into perfections. We rather diſcover in God, what he is not, than what hee is: and imperfections which cannot poſſibly ſuit with him, doe ſooner preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our imaginations, than perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though abſolutely eſſentiall in him.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13114:80"/>A ſmall errour was ſoone eſpied in certaine pictures <hi>Apelles</hi> expoſed in publike, but a thouſand excellent touches therein were not at all obſerved. <hi>Philopaemons</hi> dwarf like ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was contemned, but the magnanimity of his ſpirit uncommended. One houre of Eclipſe cauſeth the Sunne to be more gazed at, than a thouſand cleare dayes. All men looke upon the Sunne in Eclipſe, but there never was any, ſave one onely <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who loſt his ſight by the over great pleaſure he tooke in fixedly beholding thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beames. Thoſe ſouldiers who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Caeſars</hi> triumph, publiſhed his vices, but concealed his victories. Briefly, one ſingle imperfection among a million of excellent endowments in a publike perſon, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſtirre up the ſting of tongues. As one onely ulcer in a ſound body, is enough to draw flyes to fall upon it. So as the moſt certainetriall of a vertue appearing in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, is the good reputation and common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the people, by ſo much the leſſe ſuſpected when it praiſeth, as it is more inclinable to carpe, than commend: and in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13114:80"/>that nature and cuſtome inclining it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, there had need be a very ſolid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to draw it to commendations. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall voyce is very defective in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the knowledge of ſuch truths as we are to follow, and in the election of thoſe good things we are to affect; ſince the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not reaſon rule theſe decrees. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herein this ſentence is verified, <hi>That the greateſt voyce is the worſt.</hi> But in the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or reprobation, in the blame or praiſe of publike perſons, experience hath almoſt at all times verified this contrary Maxime: <hi>The voyce of the people is the voyce of God.</hi> And it is a ſtrange thing to conſider, how that which cauſeth them to erre in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of generall truth, keepes them from erring ſo eaſily in the approbation of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions: The reaſon is, for that before they approve any action, but chiefly a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like one concerning themſelves, as being good, and juſt, it is neceſſary the benefit be ſo cleare, ſo evident, and palpable, as to cauſe it ſelfe to be perceived by its utility, and to diſcover it ſelfe by its owne cleareneſſe.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13114:81"/>Setled and well framed ſpirits, judging by Maximes, preſently perceive a farre off, the good of a publike action; but the muddy-brain'd multitude judging onely by the ſenſe, ſeeth not at all, but when experience hath ſo manifeſted it unto them as there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be made: It knoweth not how to commend, but when it taſteth the fruit. Wherefore in this point, the voyce of the people is ordinarily an Oracle. Beſdes, the knowledge of what is worthy of honour, is generall to all, and is often more cleare in thoſe, in whom art hath not corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and who not knowing how to cloake ill, by reaſons, precepts, and apparances of good, cannot admit nor approve good but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Moreover, God often pronounceth his judgements by the mouth of the people. <hi>Balaams</hi> ſhe-Aſſe ſpeakes, and God inſpireth words. Sucking babes unlooſe the ſtring of their ſtammering tongues to praiſe vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons: now it is God himſelfe who makth uſe of babes and ſucklings, to raiſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13114:81"/>the praiſes of vertuous perſons to farther perfection: they afford the tongue, God gives the motion; the ſuffrage is from earth, but the ſentence from heaven.</p>
                  <p>All this proves, how the common voice of the people in the praiſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of famous perſons, ſeldome ſtraye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, to be onely approved by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for ſome ſhort time, or during the hear of ſome plauſible action, is rather to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a ſudden flaſh of fortune, than any true teſtimony of merit: it is rather a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach than a glory: ſince this may well happen to moſt wicked perſons, to the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, to <hi>Saturnines,</hi> to <hi>Gracchies.</hi> But to be conſtantly, and with perſeverance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by common ſuffrages, cannot bee other than juſtly, and with reaſon. <hi>Phocion</hi> himſelfe, and <hi>Ariſtides</hi> have not enjoyed this priviledge, to whom though vertue hath not beene deficient, yet hath good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fayled them.

And firſt, of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation which they who deſire to profit the publicke, haue, to endeavour to acquire, and conſerve this good repute. A good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation maketh not the vertue greater, but onely more illuſtrious; it affordeth it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farther perfection, but greater glory; and as the light of the Sunne addeth nothing to the beauty of the Vniverſe, but doth onely manifeſt it, and expoſe it to ſight: ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is a light which augmenteth not, but diſcouereth the beauty of vertue: Praiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth not, but declareth merit. Now it is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13114:83"/>not ſufficient for man (borne for ſociety) to be good in himſelfe, if he appeare not ſo to others, and that he be acknowledged for a good man, not ſo much for his priuate glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as for the publike avayle; ſince if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelfe with the teſtimony of his priuate conſcience, he neglect that of a good name: he is unjuſt toward himſelfe, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himſelfe of the honour due to vertue; and more unjuſt toward others in fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them of the fruit of that good example he oweth them. For it is another fruit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that by making vertue more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he thereby maketh it more uſefull, and by how much he cauſeth it to be more cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcible, the more profitable doth he make it; the prayſe he produceth being as a ſacred ſeed cauſing either the ſecret reproach of the oppoſite vice, or the deſire of a like ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to ſpring in all hearts. It is moreover the na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ure of good to become more profitable, the farther it is diffuſed. Whence it is, that all things naturally have either ſeed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate by the production of their ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blables whatſoever good they have, or an
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13114:83"/>inclination to diffuſe themſelves to the end to communicate them. Salt hath not its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but to the end to beſtow it; Muske its ſcent, but to impart it, the Sun its light, but to make it common. All whatſoever hath any perfection capable of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is borne for others: ſhould vertue then alone be to it ſelfe? ſhould it be ſolitarie in the world, or ſo envious, as to hide her beauty, or ſo particular, as thereof to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the publicke? If ſhe conceale the good ſhe hath through envy, ſhe is criminall, if by negligence, ſhe is vicious, if to avoyd the danger of vanity, her over-adviſedneſſe makes her timorous, and this over-much feare reprehenſible.

If avarice poſſeſſe them, extortion followes; if ambition, private plottings; if choler, cruelties; if hatred, revenge; if envy, looke for commotions, the overthrow of all States.</p>

Of ſo great importance is it, that the paſſions of great perſons ſhould be contained by the bridle of reaſon, as the furie of wilde beaſts under iron and chaines. So wofull a thing it is, when a foole and a ſword, vice and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, paſſion and power meete together. But vertues concerning the government of particulars, are yet neceſſary in publicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for a concluding conſideration; to wit, for the acquiring reputation and good ſame, being things of no meane conſequence for the maintaining authority. For, though men be obliged to reverence power, ſo it is notwithſtanding, that they cannot reverence it heartily, unleſſe it be viſibly accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a good life. Otherwiſe they cauſe us to be of <hi>Salvians</hi> opinion: <hi>That dignity
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:13114:93"/>in an unworthy perſon, is an ornament in the dirt:</hi> Or as Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he who is a ſervant to ſinne,</hi>

                  <p>True it is, that nature made all men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, but if order will have a diſtinction of rankes, Iuſtice ought to make this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and merit the election. And though both divine and humane lawes command us to honour our ſuperiours, though vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and irregular; yet ſo it is, as we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in this caſe, betweene the dignity and the perſon, betweene the Image of <hi>Iſis,</hi> and the Aſſe that carried her. Reverence is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſlacke, and ſubject to the leaſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and chances, when it is, as it were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided betweene honour and ſcorne.</p>
                  <p>It followes therefore, that the true means to maintaine the honour of any office, is to joyne thereto a good life, which cauſeth the perſon to be reverenced.</p>

Whereupon <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Great was not in the wrong, when hee tearmed himſelfe a Biſhop out of the Church; ſince the ſame care and vigilancy which Biſhops have within the Church to traine up ſoules to God, either by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, example, commandement, or by the threats of the ſpirituall ſword: the like had this religious Prince abroad in Policy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his State, by his perſwaſions, by his exemplary life, by his lawes, and by the power of the temporall ſword. Not putting (by uſurpation) the ſickle of his authority into the Churches harveſt; but zealouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording the charitable hand of publicke
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13114:95"/>force to the reapers therein. Now Princes and thoſe who have the adminiſtration of States under them, have double meanes to arrive to this end, whereto they ought to tend: juſtneſſe of lawes and exemplarity of their lives. The law commands, forbids, permits, puniſheth, recompenceth; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands good, forbids evill, permits what is indifferent, puniſheth tranſgreſſions, rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth obedience. When example comes from whence law proceeds; without comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it commands the good in doing it; without forbidding, it forbids evill, in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; without ſpeaking, it permits what is lawfull in practiſing it: &amp; beſides, it makes all men clearely ſee the equity of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in avoyding what the law accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth criminall, and the juſtice of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, in performing thoſe things ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth. The law, for its enforcements, hath Iudges, Sergeants, Executioners, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, Gallowes, Whips, the Sword and conſtraint. Example hath onely mildeneſſe, attractions, ſweetneſſe, love, reaſon; yet doth it ſooner reduce men under the yoake
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:13114:95"/>of its Empire, thus naked and diſarmed, then the law, as well armed as it is. For, the arms of law can onely ſtrike the body, but the ſhafts of example ſlide even into the heart and ſoule. Gayning the heart, the whole man is caught, the Will is enchained, the affections captivated, and are ſooner drawn to their duty by the mildneſſe of reaſon, than by the rigour of commandment. Men (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) truſt more to their eye, than their eares, to what they ſee, than to what they heare.</p>

Example hath more efficacy than Philoſophy to teach, more perſwaſion than eloquence to incite, more authority than the law to command, and is of greater force than armes to compell: Without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments it convinceth, without diſcourſe it perſwadeth, without menaces it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, without Serjeants it conſtraineth, and forceth men; yea, even thoſe who will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:13114:96"/>credit reaſon, nor conſent to perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor obey authority, nor feare any force, cannot refuſe imitation to good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. And though the law, and force, have often more power to deter men from vice, yet at leaſt it cannot be denyed, but exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath greater power to incline them to vertue, which is the end of the law; and the ayme of its menaces and chaſtiſements. Example propoſeth vertue not as dead, in writing, but lively in action; it ſheweth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not imperious in its precepts, but attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in its operations; it intimateth the law, not by the commandment of the ſuperiour, but by his life; which doth more powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command And truely, ſince civill Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſay, that the Magiſtrate himſelfe is the living law, ough he not likewiſe to affirme, that his good example is a lively and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall promulgation of the law? Hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the obligation, tying thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to joyne good example to juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, to eſtabliſh the one by the other, and not to deſtroy obedience in infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours by neglect; or authority in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13114:96"/>by vice; and in all men, good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by licentiouſneſſe. But beſides the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, we are to obſerve the credit Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath over hearts: Is there any thing more juſt, than from whence the law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, thence ſhould the modell for the obſervation thereof iſſue; and that the ſame power, intimating it as needfull to reaſon, ſhould make it gratefull to the will. Men whom nature hath made free, would not be ruled Deſpotically, and ſervilely (as the Philoſopher ſaith) but Royally and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly. They are rather to be induced by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than hated by conſtraint; and by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by example the Iuſtice of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements to cauſe the neceſſity of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to become voluntary by the deſire of imitation. But if the ſuperiour doe that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe which he forbiddeth, or doth not the ſame he commandeth, hee either condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his law by his life, or his life by his law, ſhewing how eyther his law is unjuſt, or his life irregular, or both the one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ridiculous.</p>

So as at the ſame inſtant he is placed over all, hee obligeth himſelfe to ſerve all, and ſels them his owne liberty, when he accepteth the honour.

                  <p>Moreover, the Scripture termeth them Sentinels, who are appointed over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the ranke which raiſeth them is as a loope-hole, from whence they ought to watch for the good of all, whileſt others reſt. The waking eye watching over the Scepter, and the Lyon, King of beaſts, who ſleepeth not but open eyed, were the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks the Egyptians made uſe of, to denote providence as aſſociate to power, and vigilancy as inſeparable from authority. God whoſe power extendeth it ſelfe over all creatures, doth likewiſe manifeſt his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over all: he ſendeth his eye as far as his Scepter; hee beholds with the one, whatſoever hee toucheth with the other. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaw a watchfull rod; both to ſhew his power ſupereminent above all, and his mercy moſt vigilant over all things. The Angels to whom God hath
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13114:102"/>appointed the guidance of the heavens mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the care of Empires, and charge of ſoules, ceaſe not to watch continually; they never loſe ſight of what they have in charge. And the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> beheld them in forme of creatures full of eyes. The heavens commanding the Elements and all inferiour bodies, turne inceſſantly, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping continuall watches about them: and the Sunne is placed on high to give light and to ſhew day to all, to rejoyce all, to quicken all, to be as the common father, and that by his heat to fructifie, and make apt for production all whatſoever is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Obſerve you not that his vigilancy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuteth his charge, that his care enobleth his power, and how ſwiftly he runs; and like a Gyant (as the Prophet ſpeaketh) leapes from one end of the heavens to another, in the execution of his office?</p>
                  <p>Man having the charge and conduct of all this inferiour world, caſts his eye, his ſpirit, and care over all: he poſts from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to Province, croſſes the ſeas, ſoundeth the depth, overpaſſeth mountaines, climes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13114:102"/>rockes, deſcends precipices, opens the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes of the earth, ſearcheth into the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of living creatures, plants and minerals, diſpoſeth and applyeth all to the uſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by nature, nor doth any thing, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his dominion, eſcape his providence. The wit of man which oweth direction to all in man; to his powers, his motions, his ſeverall members, and whole body; doe you not plainely ſee how it hath received from God a prompt, quicke, and active quality, to foreſee all theſe dangers, and to provide for all thoſe neceſſities? Briefly, whatſoever God hath eſtabliſhed in this world with any power and ſuperiority, doth beare witneſſe of his providence over all things ſubjected unto him? Care doth at all times attend on power, the rod is watchfull, the Lyon holds his eyes open, and the eye accompanieth the Scepter. Are not theſe ſo many leſſons to thoſe, who conſtituted in dignity, are as the moving ſpirits, the heavens, the Suns, the Intelligences, and the petty Gods of this world: to ſhew, that as ſpirits they owe us vigilancy, as heavens, expedition; as Suns,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13114:103"/>light; as Angels, tuition; and as Gods their care and providence. If publicke charge be conferred upon thee, be not puffed up above the reſt, but have care of them, ſaith the ſpirit of God in Scripture. Honours and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are not ſubjects of ambition, but of care and travaile. Beſides, it is an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thing, after one hath ſought for offices, as though hee merited the ſame, to behave himſelfe therein as though he ſcorned them.</p>

So the ſpirit preoccupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by private intereſt, cannot (in conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) diſcern the truth of things, regarding only its proper vice in all places; and, even in publick, ayming only at his owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: his profit is a perpetuall object unto him in all his counſels, he in all things ſeeth his beloved gold, he finds it all over, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into gold, not as <hi>Midas,</hi> all he toucheth, but whatſoever he ſeeth. Whereupon <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> uttered this true maxime;<note place="margin">Tac. l. <hi>1.</hi> hiſt.</note> That private profit is the poyſon of ſound judgement, and of the right affection of men.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13114:107"/>from medling with the publick, who had not abſtayned for ten yeeres from all traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique and merchandize.</p>
                  <p>Yet is not this all when we ſay, how this paſſion hindereth good counſels, blindeth the ſpirits, and deregulateth our wils: It far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produceth more fatall effects, when power furniſheth us with inſtruments for malice. It is the nature of fire never to bee ſatisfied with flaming, proportionably to the combuſtible matter it meets with; if it finde no ſubject to work upon, it quickly goeth out; if it have ſmall nouriſhment, it burnes ſlowly, and, as though abundance made it hunger-ſtarved, the more it findes, the faſter it devoures it, and the more it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth, the more inſatiable it appeareth. This is the lively image of covetouſneſſe, which, as fire, converteth all to his private advantage. The matter it findes, quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not, but quickens it, gayne ſlaketh it not, but provoketh it: it is petty in the poore, ardent in the rich, but ravenous in great ones; and when at any time it fals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great fortune, augmenting and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13114:108"/>like fire, it ruines Cities, and layes Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires waſle.</p>
                  <p>They whom the fire of paſſion doth once enflame, become abſolutly blinded; the like happening to them which <hi>David</hi> ſaid; <hi>The fire is faln upon them, and they have not ſeen the Sunne.</hi> They conſider not, that there is nothing ſo ſhamefull and baſe, as profit drawn from the groanes of miſerable perſons: it is as much (as Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith) to make our ſelves Horſe-courſers, Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Pedlers of publick calamities. And as husbandmen deſire raine and ill weather to cauſe their graine to grow, ſo thoſe not only deſire, but (which is worſe) they covet to extend and amplifie the peoples afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to rayſe themſelves out of their ruines, and to force them to ſhed teares, to ripen their gold, an accurſed harveſt of ſo fatall a ſeed.</p>

                  <p>Therefore the great miſchiefes which covetouſneſſe hatcheth, having regard only to private intereſt, ſufficiently ſhew how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and requiſit Integrity proceeding from Iuſtice, is to him who undertaketh a publick charge, who is not to reflect upon what is permitted to his power, but what is committed to his faith. It is a holy depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which faith ought to obſerve, &amp; not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer covetouſneſſe to convert it to its owne uſe, or rather abuſe. And if the Law terme that ſacred which is depoſited into the hands of particulars; how much more is that ſacred, which is committed to publick truſt? Integrity breeds fidelity, affordeth good counſels, nouriſheth prudence, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth the ſpirits, regulateth deſires, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſeth affection towards duty, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelfe neither to be corrupted by profit,

The Sunne caſteth his beames upon all things, notretayning them for himſelfe; ſo the profit proceeding from
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13114:109"/>juſtice, doth wholly diffuſe it ſelfe upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the merit of it only remayning to it ſelfe. And to this vertue doth that golden world belong, which <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpake of vertue in generall: <hi>Her reward is,</hi>

But juſtice framing man in ſuch faſhion, as for the good of others he neglects himſelfe, it becomes a vertue proper to thoſe who have the managing of other mens affaires, and among all,<note place="margin">Ariſt. lib. <hi>5.</hi> Ethic. cap. <hi>1.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irtus ſola ex omnibus virtutibus, alienum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num videtur ſpectare, qui ad alterum ſpectat.

It is the eſſentiall and inſeparable quality, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the nature of their office, and without which they leave to be what their titles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and are as men in picture, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe than men, though they retayne the name and forme.</p>
                  <p>So the Scripture termeth the Paſtor who hath no care ſave for himſelfe only, but an Idoll, ſince he is not what men call him; he is called Paſtor by relation to others, and he
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13114:110"/>only feedeth himſelfe; ſo as hee is no better than a painted Idoll, having in him nothing leſſe than what his name imports, nor is any thing ſo little as what he appeares to bee. A title likewiſe belonging to all thoſe (who obliged to the publick) regard nothing ſave their particular intereſt; and are (to ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) none other than Idols, and phantomes, whoſe appearance dazleth our eyes, and whoſe name deludeth our eares. And truly, ſince they are not eſtabliſhed over the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but with obligation to have care on them; they violating the duty of their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, diſgrace its glory, and not performing what they promiſe, they are not really what they ſtile themſelves. They are rightly I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, ſince the figure only remayneth; not quick bodies, ſince the ſoule is vaniſhed. One may ſay of them as <hi>David</hi> did of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols among the Gentiles: <hi>They have eyes, but ſee not, eares, but underſtand not; mouthes, but ſpeak not; feet, but walk not:</hi> for they have eyes, but connive; eares, but counterfeit the deafe, dumb mouthes, and feet fixed to the center of their proper intereſt, ſince they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13114:111"/>walk not toward their obligation. They have hands, but feele not; for they being ordinarily employed in touching, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, they loſe both ſight, hearing, ſpeech, and motion. Wherefore the The bans pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Iudges and Magiſtrates without hands;<note place="margin">Pitrius in hierogly. l. <hi>38</hi>
                     </note> ſince when their hands are over long, it is much to bee feared their feet will become gouty, their tongues tied, their cares deafned, and their eyes dimmed. And the Scripture ſaith; <hi>That thoſe who take bribes, do likewiſe retaine injuſtice.</hi> I intend not hereby to prove, that injuſtice deſtroyes authority, being both by divine and humane right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable; but only that in ſuch perſons the honour and merit of poſſeſſing places of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature periſheth: the title remayneth, the merit is miſſing. Iuſtice therefore tending to the good of others, is as it were an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall quality to publick perſons, obliging them to love, and daily to procure the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good; which not only lawes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teach us, but even nature it ſelfe dictates unto us. For is it not apparant in all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary things, that whatſoever is deſtinated
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13114:111"/>for common good, operateth not for it ſelfe, but imployeth it ſelfe for all? Do not the heavens ſend forth their influences, the Sun his beames, the earth its fecundity, the trees their fruits, fountaynes their waters, Bees their honey, Silk wormes their ſubtile webs for all? Doth not the liver diſtribute blood to all the veynes, the head motion to all the nerves, the heart vigour to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? Is there any thing in nature which converteth to its owne uſe what it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for the common good? See wee not in reaſonable creatures a deſire, in unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ones a motion, in inſenſible things a kinde of inclination toward the generall good of the Vniverſe, whereby their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good ſubſiſteth? Is it not true, that by naturall inſtinct the hand caſts it ſelfe before the body, to receive upon it ſelfe the ſtrokes comming upon it; and how each part is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to preſerve the whole, though to its owne ruine? Shall not then knowledge, reaſon, and juſtice cauſe that in man, which a mere naturall inclination effecteth in all other things? But is there any thing either
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13114:112"/>more glorious, or which draweth the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture neerer to the imitation of God, than to ſeeke and procure publick good? to go leſſe therein, is it not a ſigne of indigence, and to enlarge our ſelves, a token of abundance? Who is ſo abundant as God, and who diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe like him? poverty pincheth, and reſtraineth; plenty enlargeth, and dilateth. Moreover, whatſoever is moſt excellent, and principall in all things, doth it not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate moſt, and become moſt abundant? The higheſt, and moſt elevated among the Angels, do they not take greateſt care, both of the heavens motions, of the worlds go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of mankinde in generall; thoſe of inferiour orders having the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight only of ſome ſingle Kingdome, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or City? and the loweſt orders, thoſe who have the ſingle conduct of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon? Among the ſtarres, the Sunne holding the higheſt rank, doth hee not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his lights, and influences, both upon the celeſtiall and elementary world? The Moone ſucceeding in the ſecond place, to the elementary globe only. The ſtarres, as
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13114:112"/>leaſt in dignity, to a certain ſpecies, or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduity of ſublunary things? But (I beſeech you) is there any thing ſo noble in the world, as God? in man, as the ſoule? in the body, as the heart? in the tree, as the root? All the tree is nouriſhed by the root, the heart cauſeth life in the whole body, the ſoule gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the whole man, God governeth the whole world.</p>
                  <p>To practiſe vertue in our owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is a great matter, but to exerciſe it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward others, is much more glorious; to make uſe of it toward many, is excellent; but to impart it to all, is ſupereminent. <hi>And even as</hi> (ſaith the Philoſopher) <hi>hee who is malicious toward himſelfe, and others,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ariſt. lib. <hi>5.</hi> Polit. cap. <hi>1.</hi>

                     <hi>is the worſt and moſt wicked of all men:</hi> So he who practiſeth vertue both toward himſelfe and others, is the beſt and moſt juſt among men.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>VT <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that if vertue could be viewed living, and animated with her proper attractions, ſhe would cauſe admiration in mindes, and amorous motions in all hearts. Diſcourſe can only repreſent her in picture, and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not ſtored ſufficiently with lively colours, to inſpire thereinto the ſoule and beauty of a naturall body. So as to behold Iuſtice (which my weak pencill is forced to expreſſe) in her lively and native grace, it is neceſſary to caſt our eyes upon ſome living modell; (if the world yet affords any ſuch) expreſſing in it ſelfe the beautifull idaea of this eldeſt daughter of God, which the pen is unable to depaint. O more worthy the name of Great than <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Pompey!</hi> a man given from heaven, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling God than man; he who mouldeth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13114:113"/>himſelfe upon this image, and whoſe ſoule is the table, his vertue the pencill, his actions the colours, and whoſe life is the ſoule of that living image, drawn upon the proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of this divine pattern: God in this mans heart hath engraven a lively knowledge of this truth, that thoſe whoſe dignities cauſe them neereſt to reſemble him, ought moſt neerely to approach unto him by duty and love; and that the degree of piety ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize that of preferment; that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the benefit received, ſhould bee the modell of acknowledgement. To conſider likewiſe, that the higheſt Angels are moſt ardent in his love, the prompteſt to know and accompliſh his commandements. And from this Principle (as from a celeſtiall ſeed) we ſee, ſpring the bleſſed maximes confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to eternall verities; Iuſt counſels, ſage advices, the adminiſtration of earthly things according to celeſtiall lawes; briefly, all the fruits worthy of this Chriſtian, and divine Philoſophy. Hee then ſeeth how Iuſtice being obliged to allow to each man what is his right, that after the ſervice due to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13114:114"/>Almighty God, the regulating of our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners being a right due to our ſelves, holdeth the firſt rank in obligation, and ought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to have the firſt place in diſcharge; hee knoweth how the rule which ought to bee as the modell to all the world, ought chiefly to be very direct in it ſelfe. That the words of Iuſtice are found to be of very flat taſte, if the ſoule ſavour not the fruits. That to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern well, and live wickedly, if it bee not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible, is at leaſt diſhoneſt. That ſage counſels do only profit others, but a lewd life endammageth its authour. That there is nothing ſo fooliſh as to follow the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, who ſpins ſilk for us, and ends her dayes in the action; induſtrious for others, to himſelfe pernicious: hee in concluſion ſees, how after he hath ſet himſelfe in good order, the laſt duty of Politick Iuſtice is, to be carefull of the publick good, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe his proper intereſt.</p>
                  <p>That it is as much as to make himſelfe pretious, not to be bought or allured by any reward. That there is nothing ſo glorious, as to ſhew himſelfe incorrnptible in an age
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13114:114"/>wherein the glittering of gold tempteth the fidelity of all, and overcometh the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of many.</p>
                  <p>That Integrity then is moſt laudable, when by reaſon of corrupted times, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe ſeemes to bee excuſable. That it is an unworthy thing, to make the earths ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements mens Idols; and that thoſe baſe metals Nature buries in her loweſt bottoms, ſhould uſurp the principall place in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a reaſonable ſoule. That it is a ſhame and reproach to Chriſtians, to ſee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pagans ſhew greater integrity, and more incorruption, and affection to the publick good in the adminiſtration of Offices, than we do. That the ancient Romans (as <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi> the great, witneſſeth) namely thoſe of the Aelian family, rather choſe to bee poore in a plentifull Republick, then rich in a poore one. And that now, even thoſe who profeſſe the knowledge of the true God, bluſh not at all when they impoveriſh whole Cities, and Kingdomes, to enrich their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate families with publick ſpoyles.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:13114:117"/>to apprehend, and an appetite to incline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards things fitting for them, if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they wanted both feet and wings to convey them whither their appetite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth them for the obtayning what their ſenſe apprehendeth. The Art and will of ſayling, plowing, painting, building, what uſe would they afford to the Pilot, Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Painter, or Architect, if the laſt wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his trowell to ſet hands to work, the next his pencill for the expreſſion of his idaeas, the third his plough to ſtirre the earth, the fourth his rudder and ſayles to part the waves? Knowledge is unprofitable where power fayleth, and vaine the deſire which cannot arrive to its ayme. The wiſdome of God knoweth all things, and his bounty is boundleſſe; but had he not equall power to bring to light both what he knoweth and willeth, his bounty would remayn fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and his wiſdome workleſſe: the one could not appeare, the other not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it ſelfe, nor ſhould wee know either how much the one knoweth, or how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the other loveth us? It is (therefore) not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:13114:117"/>enough to have treated of, and handled (in the two former Bookes) the vertues inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the underſtanding in the knowledge of good, and thoſe in particular diſpoſing the will to love and ſearch the known good, if wee do not farther adde thoſe qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to enable us for the production, and putting them in practiſe, to the end to arm politick vertue with all her neceſſary peeces. Firſt then, wiſdome and prudence afford ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and ſufficiency; Iuſtice, honeſty, and their aſſociats, inſpire a good affection, and right intention. It remaineth that I ſhew thoſe parts, adding thereto force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But even thoſe vertues ſerving for knowing and willing good, do alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the enablement and action. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very vertue is a habitude and perfection ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the powers of the reaſonable ſoule, to afford it the dexterity, the vigour, the eaſe, and facility to operate, and act agreeably to the rules of reaſon: Whereupon the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers generally call Vertue, an operative habitude, ſince every vertue tends to action: and (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) <hi>Vertue is no other, than
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:13114:118"/>a quality making him good who poſſeſſeth it,</hi>

                     <hi>and his operation laudable.</hi> So as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was in the right when in generall hee names Vertue, <hi>A quality for the well ordering the actions of this life:</hi> and more briefly; <hi>The good,</hi>

                     <hi>and right uſe of freewill.</hi> So in that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vertue reflecteth upon the action as its aym and fruit, thoſe vertues ſhewing light, whereby to know good, and inclining us to love it, do likewiſe afford us the ability to produce it. The ſame vigour of the root, of which the tree makes uſe towards the conception and form of the fruit, is likewiſe ſerviceable thereto for the production and perfection thereof. And the ſame wind cauſing a ſhip to lanch forth and ſayle, doth likewiſe drive it into the haven. The like agility animating the runner of the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick games to appeare in the liſts, doth alſo cauſe him to perform his race, to touch the goal, and gain the prize, and that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to give him motion to his courſe, doth conſequently afford him both progreſſe and victory. Wiſdome and Prudence are not only (even before the action) uſefull for the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:13114:118"/>underſtanding of what is fit to bee done, and of the meanes we are therein to uſe, but they further guide the courſe of the action; and the one ſerving as a fane, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting and preſcribing the meaſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company and carry it to the deſired end. In like manner, juſtice, honeſty, and all vertues thereon depending; beſides, that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and inc ine the ſoule to honeſt and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable actions, they are likewiſe very uſefull in the exerciſe of the very actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; not only cauſing man to be willing, but to be able alſo to do good; yet do I find notwithſtanding certaine qualities and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues properly deſtinated for the diſcloſing and producing of what prudence hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and juſtice deſigned as honeſt, and profitable. Vertues and qualities, without which juſtice hath (often) only good wiſhes without fruit, and prudence ſage counſels without ſucceſſe. Now theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are chiefly required in publick perſons, encountring in their moſt pious enterprizes a thouſand obſtacles through which they are to break; lets which they are to rebate,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13114:119"/>difficulties which they are to overcome, and this not being feaſeable for them without neceſſary armes; their honeſty remayneth uſeleſſe, and their wiſdome fruitleſſe, if they be thereof unprovided. I reduce theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to foure heads; Authority, Good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Courage, and Eloquence. Authority cauſeth ſage and juſt counſels to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Good Fortune makes them ſuccesfull; Courage addes credit therto; and Eloquence perſwades the performance: and in truth, without Eloquence they often appeare bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without Courage weak, without Good Fortune fruitleſſe, and nullified without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. So as Authority cauſeth them to overcome all obſtacles, Good Fortune all difficulties, Courage all reſiſtances, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence all humane averſions, and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yet will I not ſay, either that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is a vertue, or that Authority, or Good Fortune are inherent qualities and faſtned to man as habitudes. Courage, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing out of Fortitude and Magnanimity, juſtly holdeth one of the firſt ranks among politick vertues, as I will ſhew in the ſequell
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13114:119"/>of this Diſcourſe. But Authority, and Good fortune, are but exteriour guifts of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in us, but by his onely favour, when at any time he authorizeth us among men, cauſing our good counſels happily to ſucceed both for his glory and the generall good. And as for Eloquence, it is no vertue but an Inſtrument cauſing vertues to be of validitie, and an ornament decking and beautifying them. Now (to place theſe foure qualities in their proper rankes, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,) know; that authority conferreth cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; Good fortune, ſucceſſefulneſſe; Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, reſolution, and conſtancie: Eloquence, perſwaſion, gracefulneſſe, and as it were Beautie: And all theſe foure united, give perfection to Politicke Vertue, and a Period to my intended Worke.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:13114:120"/>with integritie; yet ſo it is, they are not ſo much as liſtned unto. What in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans mouth would carry weight with it, looſeth its eſtimate in theirs, and their Prudence is like the Gold and Pearles in ſome Countryes where the Inhabitants eyther regard them not, or ſlight them, as not knowing their worth. Who knowes not that Cockles marked with the publicke ſtampe, are the currant coyne in certaine newly diſcovered Countries, namely in <hi>Congo.</hi> For, it is not the ſcarcitie of gold and ſilver, which reduceth them to this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but either the ignorance, contempt, or a contrary cuſtome. Gold and ſilver abound there, but theſe people yeeld the precedence to baſe Cockle-ſhels, if not in price, at leaſt in imployment: The former looſing in theſe mens opinions, the ranke and dignity, Nature allowes them. Gold was not in uſe in the Citie of <hi>Sparta,</hi> by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his Lawes, but Iron onely, which bearing the publike ſtamp, was able, and did all things in matter of commerce; whileſt gold (though more rich and precious) lay unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13114:121"/>moulding in ſome obſcure retreat. The like eſtimate the publick ſtamp gives to coynes, generall opinion, but chiefly that of the Prince, (whence authority hath its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection) beſtoweth upon men. Without this ſtamp, gold is not valuable to iron: with this Marke, iron paſſeth for gold. It is not ſo much the worth, as the eſteeme, which ſetteth a value upon all things in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of this world. It is the like of wiſdome and vertue, as of the precious ſtone called <hi>Phengite:</hi> which though right beautifull, and of excellent luſter, yet remaineth it dull and darke, if the Sunne ſhine not thereon: ſo the moſt excellent qualities languiſh and wither, as unknowne and deſpiſed, if the light of publike eſteeme, doth not thereto adde both luſter, and authority. For we are to acknowledge the powerfull Empire, which opinion hath eyther acquired, or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped over humane ſpirits, an Empire of ſuch extent, as ſhe takes notice of all things, and ſo abſolute, as there is no farther any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from the Decrees ſhe pronouneeth. And though an ancient Sage ſayd: that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13114:121"/>truth is the ſtrongeſt and moſt powerfull thing; yet ſo it is, that opinion often robs her other rayments, and ſeizeth on her ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſo as if ſhe once eſtabliſher throne in mens thoughts, truth will be ill troubled to regain poſſeſſion: ſhee commandeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction, ſhee governs at pleaſure, ſhee rayſeth what delighteth her, and repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth what ſhe diſeſteemeth, ſhe ſets the price on all things; on wits, on vertues, on indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, on ſcience, and whatſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Vertue deſiring to become profitable for the publick, ought to ſeek the ſuffrage of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick opinion to bee authorized, and by the authority which opinion acquireth for her in mens ſpirits, to allow weight to her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and effects to her juſt intentions.

The Authoritie of <hi>Phocion</hi> at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> of <hi>Cato</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> hath often wrought the like wonders; when any queſtion aroſe eyther of cauſing a good counſell to paſſe current, to reject reproveable ones, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh juſtice or repell violence.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:13114:125"/>treat, floweth from this fountain. It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God himſelfe with his all-powerfull finger hath engraven a certain touch of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Majeſty upon their foreheads whom he intendeth to authorize, and make uſefull for humane ſociety. It is ſayd, how that divers families in <hi>Rome</hi> had certain he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary marks, as of a fitch, a dryed peaſe, or an iron-mole, appearing upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or face of their children, cauſing their name and origen to be immediatly known, even to thoſe who were not acquainted with their perſons. So God ſeemeth in all States and Kingdomes to make choice of certain families and races, as inſtruments of his Providence, in the conduct and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of publick good, in ſo much as all their deſcendants beare a certain character, and ſhew a kinde of gracefulneſſe cauſing all men to acknowledge them, authorizing them without further triall of their ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, than this only honour following them as an hereditary title.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:13114:125"/>authority together with the name, though experience doth ſufficiently declare the truth thereof, the ſacred Scripture doth yet farther furniſh us with faire precedents, and remarkable examples: For we read of the race of the <hi>Machabees,</hi>

                     <hi>They were not of the race of them from whom the ſafety of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ought to come.</hi> A remarkable word, whereby God declareth unto us the election, which his providence maketh of certain families, whereof he intendeth to make uſe, as of his inſtruments, in what hee deſigneth for the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:13114:126"/>common ſafety of Empires. So among all the families in the world he (heretofore) made choice of that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> therein to conſerve the worſhip of his name, and the hope of the ſalvation of all mankinde. He (after) elected the family of <hi>Levi,</hi> for the Prieſthood; the family of <hi>Iudah,</hi> for the Crown; and the family of the <hi>Machabees</hi> (as I have formerly ſayd) to revenge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach offered againſt <hi>Iſrael. Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> have likewiſe had certaine names and races fatall for their glory, and who might well be termed the pillers and baſes of their greatneſſe. And our hiſtory conſerveth the memory of divers illuſtrious families, which ſeem to have been deſtinated by heaven, to defend the beauty of our Flower de Luces from the injury of times, and to maintayn amidſt the frownes and ſtorms of fortune the majeſty of our Kings, and the glory of their Crownes. Their names are ſo well known, that ſhould I place them upon this paper (it not being of neceſſity) I might be ſuſpected of flattery. But I ſay, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of ſuch families, carry even from
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:13114:126"/>their mothers womb, not as our old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, the mark of a burning ſword imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on their thigh, but the authority of an hereditary reputation engraven on their names, preparing and leveling them the way to brave and illuſtrious actions. Which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth mee to ſay, this authority is a gift from God, ſince the lot of our birth is not at our election to make choice of the place of his origin. Every one (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayd right e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly) would uſurp the birth-right of ſome rich and renowned family. But even when we are not, God (who beſtowes our being upon us) chuſeth for us, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth both the time and place. Nor is this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority whereof we treat, in this regard on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a gift from heaven; but likewiſe in that God beſtoweth on ſome, certaine naturall graces, authorizing and making them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pleaſing both to King and people. So God authorized <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the eye of <hi>Pharaob; Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the ſight of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor; Mordochay</hi> in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> in the opinion of <hi>Aſſuerus; Eſdras</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> in the good grace of <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> and divers
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:13114:127"/>others upon ſeveral occaſions, who making uſe of this authority, not for their particular emolument, but for publick employment, have appeared as ſacred anchors in ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tempeſts, to deliver Gods people from imminent ſhip wrack. And here may enter all thoſe gifts called gifts of nature, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and thoſe likewiſe called Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; to wit, gifts of grace beſtowed gratis, depending not on us, nor our merit, but on the pure diſpoſition and liberality of God.

So Authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the light of vertue, riſeth and ſhineth by the happy encounter of divers excellent parts. Firſt, the nobility and antiquity of blood, greatly authorizeth a mans vertue, (as we have already ſhewed:) and though ſome would ſay as <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> anſwered to <hi>Ajax;</hi> that the famous acts of our forefathers are
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:13114:127"/>not ours, but theirs: yet in truth they are ours by a double meanes; ours by title of ſucceſſion, giving us right not only to the poſſeſſions, but to the honours alſo of our Anceſtors: and yet more ours by right of imitation, when we tread in the ſteps of their vertuous examples. And though ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have affirmed that nobility of race be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an externall good, addeth nothing to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane poſterity; yet, to take it even in the moſt rigorous ſenſe, this externall good joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to internall endowments, is a ſurpluſage of good, ſo farre forth as hee who hath not this benefit, is deficient in a neceſſary good; and whoſo hath this prerogative above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though otherwiſe all things be equall, yet hath he ſtill advantage over him. And beſides, wee do not conſider man metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically alone, abſtracted and divided from other men, but reflect upon him as in civill community and ſociety, where doubtleſſe the ſplendor and nobility of race, doth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily confer that eſtimation and credence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, which a new commer, how wiſe, and vertuous ſoever he be, ſhall not acquire
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13114:128"/>till hee have given divers good teſtimonies of his actions. Wherefore <hi>Saluſt</hi> obſerveth, that the ancient Romans were of opinion, that it was a ſtayn and blemiſh to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulary honour, if they ſhould confer it upon a new commer, though adorned with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and merit: yet when all is ſayd, we muſt avow that nobility without vertue, is but diſgracefull, as on the other ſide, vertue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out nobility remayneth low priced; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility adorned with vertue, and vertue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed by nobility, rayſeth a man to the higheſt rank of honour: and hee in whom theſe two concurre, hath the glory a man can aſtayn unto, ſince he hath the heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry joyned to the acquired right. In a ſecond place, riches adde much to authority, when they come either by juſt ſucceſſion, or by lawfull and honeſt acquiſition. Now it is the like of riches, as of waters which cannot be clear and wholſome, if their ſource be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure: for if wee ſee a family abounding in temporall ſubſtance, men preſently diſpute how it was rayſed; as the Geographers do of the river <hi>Nilus.</hi> Dogs are ordinarily ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13114:128"/>by reaſon of their dangerous teeth, the Wolfe for his wide throat, the Lion for his pawes, the Eagle for his tallents, the Fox for his crafty tricks, and all beaſts of prey for their fraud and violence. And though <hi>Cacus</hi> forced the ſtoln cattell hee conveyed to his Cave, to be drawn thither back ward, yet ſo it is, that the ſimpleſt perſons could go direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thitherto diſcover what they ſuppoſed to bee there concealed.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13114:129"/>and our perfect felicity, though after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection the body being again reunited to the glorious and immortall ſoule, corporall benefits againe concurre, though not as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and neceſſary, yet at leaſt as adjuncts, and well befitting the perfection of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitude. So as you ſee on all ſides how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſubſtance addeth ſomething to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane felicity, yet not to cauſe us to bee of the <hi>Peripatetians</hi> opinion, who in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to their <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſuppoſed a man could not be happy in this life, without the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of externall things, ſince to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Chriſtian diſcipline preferreth the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of things before abundance, and the deſpiſement thereof before the poſſeſſion; but wee only ſay, that a well ordered reaſon making uſe of temporall bleſſings to Gods glory, they become a great and powerfull inſtrument in the exerciſe of vertues, in the well uſing whereof conſiſts our preſent feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Riches are of themſelves things of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, the well beſtowing them makes them good, and the abuſe thereof cauſeth them to become naught, and as they ſerve
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13114:129"/>for ſubject of vice in the hands of wicked perſons, ſo afford they weapons to good mens vertues; and chiefly to the vertue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in publick, and which (rightly to ſhew it ſelfe upon this worlds Theater) hath uſe of exteriour aſſiſtances. Without which vertue becomes weak and languiſhing, and though not without merit in Gods ſight, yet at leaſt without action, fruit, and glory before men. For as the faults which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the will, are no way prejudiciall to civill ſociety, and conſequently deſerve no puniſhment by humane juſtice, according to the Civilians rules (ſave only in caſe of high treaſon) where all is puniſhable,<note place="margin">Voluntatis poenam nenso patitur.</note> both the deſire, the effect, the heart, the hand. So the good which is only in intention, brings no commodity to the publick, nor doth it from thence merit either glory or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. But vertue wanting the inſtrument of riches to bring to light her fayre deſignes, is conſtrained to ſmother thouſands of good intentions, as being unable to diſcloſe them; and as much as poverty bereaveth him of divers occaſions to appeare, and profit in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:13114:130"/>publick, ſo much glory, credit, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doth it cauſe him to loſe: So as his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inclination elevating him on the one ſide, and his diſability dejecting him on the other,<note place="margin">Alciat. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t me plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma levat, ſic grave mergit onus.</note> it hapneth to him as to the party in the Emblem, whom the weight clogged as much as the wing elevated.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13114:133"/>had over woman by prerogative of dignity, woman ſhould get the like above man by her gracefull attractions. To be ſhort, there is not any more ſtrong charm to gayne hearts, and poſſeſſe wils, than corporall beauty and majeſty, eſtabliſhing an inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble empire over all beholders without need either of lawes or guards.</p>
                  <p>So as if the baits and attractions of the minde meet with thoſe of the body, it is ſufficient to make a man lord of all hearts, and abſolute king over all affections, ſince by his exteriour graces hee gaineth the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars opinion; and by his interlour, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and eſtimation of the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; ſo as captivating ſome by the body, and others by the ſpirit, he maketh himſelfe maſter of all. Now among the gifts of the ſpirit, ſtrength and ſolidity of judgement is preſerable to all others, and it is that chiefly which cauſeth a man to be reverenced, and doth moſt authorize him. For whatſoever in this world is moſt powerfull, is at length forced to yeeld to the ſtrength of reaſon: he then doubtleſſe, who hath the efficacy to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13114:133"/>cauſe the reaſon of his counſels moſt perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly to appeare in his words and actions, ſhall at all times remayn the ſtrongeſt, and foly invincible, what aſlaults ſoever aremade upon him. Riches, credit, dignities, favours, friends, knowledge, and cloquence, may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, (for an inſtant) but in the end reaſon will over-rule: and he who hath the abilities to make right uſe of theſe armes, he is furniſhed with inſtruments to ſurmount all things.</p>
                  <p>To all thoſe gifts of fortune and nature, the gifts of Grace, which Divines call freely given, and which God beſtowes for the common and univerſall good of mankinde, on thoſe whom he intendeth to authorize, and make uſefull for community, adde much weight and efficacy. Such are the gifts of counſels, knowledge, prudence, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and other heavenly gifts, (which conſidered as gifts of Grace) have in them ſomething of higher and more ſublime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and produce more powerfull effects than the ſame qualities conſidered (ſimply) as acquired habitudes. And this
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:13114:134"/>one thing doth greatly authorize a man, when there is any one thing obſerved and acknowledged in him, ſurpaſſing the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary talents of men, and which teſtifies ſome particular grace and favour from God.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common proverb; <hi>That each man is the maker of his owne fortune:</hi> ſignifying thereby, that God is not pleaſed to work all, but that man ought alſo to co-operate on his part toward the rayſing of his reputation, whether temporall here on earth, or eternall in heaven. We have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the parts, qualities, and gifts of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune nature, and grace, which make a man eminent in this world, and which acquire

But it is not all, to have the heavens liberall to ſome, and largely to impart its favours, if themſelves be not prudent and ſage to manage theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages diſcreetly, and to employ them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly to Gods glory, profitably to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, and happily to Gods honour. For as it is ſayd, that Eagles and Serpents have certain pretious ſtones in their heads; and that Griffins in the Northern <hi>Scythia,</hi> keep, in certain caves and vaults, great heaps of gold and ſilver; but becauſe themſelves know not how to make uſe thereof, this treaſure which they poſſeſſe, is of no profit to them. The ſame it is (ſometimes) of men, who endowed with divers commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable qualities, which might make them famous, and recommendable, yet thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts remayning hidden and ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in their cuſtody, they remayn fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and themſelves without fame or credit. Now it is not to bee denied, but that ſome are followed with I know not what kinde of infortunity, choaking all their worthy performances, in whatſoever they deſigne,

Now, theſe men ought to reſt contented with the teſtimony of their conſcience, being more valuable than all the Scepters and Crownes this world can afford: and which is the onely reward, whereof neither fortune nor humane ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:13114:136"/>can bereave Vertue. To deſerve ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and not to have it, is more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then to enjoy it without deſert; and the praiſe was incomparatively greater, when the queſtion was asked why the people of <hi>Rome</hi> erected not Statues for <hi>Cato</hi> in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke places of the City,<note place="margin">Plut in Cato.</note> then when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired why any were erected for him. The vertue we ſee uncrowned is alwayes moſt eſteemed by thoſe who beſt know how to ſet a true eſtimate on things: whereas (on the other ſide) there is nothing more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull, than an honour or recompence, the cauſe whereof we enquire. But howſoever it bee true, that misfortune ſtill attendeth ſome mens merits, yet ſo it is notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that as many impute the offences they have falne into to the Divels temptation; So men, often cauſe both fortune, and the time to alter through their owne errors. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they have commendable qualities, they either are ignorant how to make right uſe of them, or they abſolutely abuſe them, or neglect the right taking hold of occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo as eyther the paines in the profecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:13114:136"/>thereof affrights them, or idleneſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbes them, or pleaſure perverts &amp; deludes them. If they be Nobles they degenerate, if rich they employ not their wealth honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; If of high Dignity, they invalidate their charge; If wiſe, they force their knowledge to ſerve their particular contentments, and not the publicke good; If endowed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laudable qualities, they ſuffer them to remaine unuſefull, as the Dragons of the Gardens of the <hi>Heſperides,</hi> which keepe the golden Apples, and know not how to gather them: No marvell then, though being full ſtored with rare endowments, they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine empty of fame and reputation. Some likewiſe conceale their Talents as Ants doe their Egges and graine, to enjoy the tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a private life, which they preferre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things: Now, of theſe men there is no wonder if they have what they look for, and miſſe what they avoyd: But if they doe this out of a true neglect of the world, and a pure love toward God, they are worthy of admiration, but if onely to avoyde labour, and for their private content, (which moſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13114:137"/>often hapneth) forgetting their obligation on purpoſe to follow their humour, and preferring their particular pleaſure, before the common good, they are not ſo much as worthy of excuſe. It is not therefore ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have happy advantages, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable parts, for the acquiſition of fame, and authority, toward the opening a way to publicke profit, the principall peece being the true employment of them to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: ſince of theſe things (as of gold and riches) the uſe is more worth than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, and the employment better than the poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Now to make right uſe of heavenly gifts, and thereby to eſtabliſh and authorize our ſelves: Paines, prudence, and good fortune is to be required: Of paines, to find out oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, of Prudence to make election there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; of good fortune to finde, and profitably to employ them. Good fortune being inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on us, ought to bee remitted to Gods providence; Paines, and diſeretion beeing in our power, are part of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:13114:137"/>
                  <p>And principally thoſe who are deſcended from illuſtrious, ancient, and authoriſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies ought to acknowledge, that to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the authoritie of their Anceſtors, they are to ſupport the reputation thereof by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and that if they intend to inherit the glory and ſame their fore fathers have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they ought to ſucceed (by imitation) thoſe brave actions which have made them ſo illuſtrious. Where vertue is not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, glory cannot ſucceed, that fayling, this tendeth toward its ruine, and the flowers fading ſpeedily followeth the rootes decay. Nobility may happily paſſe, together with the bloud, from Fathers to their Children, but the honour never paſſeth but with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Deſcent alloweth the one, but imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (onely) can tranſmit the other: and if the one follow the name, the other attendeth vertue. For it is a Maxim in Philoſophie: that things are conſerved by the ſame means they are acquired, and are loſt by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. As water which gaineth its puritie by motion, conſerveth it by the ſame, and loſeth it by reſt: and Iron receiving its heat
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13114:138"/>from fire, preſerveth it in fire, and looſeth it, being removed thence. Now it is not the bloud nor the name, but the generous acts, which have acquired credit, and authority to illuſtrious families. Wherefore it is not the ſucceſſion of name, and armes, but the hereditary ſequence of vertuous actions, which can maintaine and conſerve it. So as if Children degenerate from their Anceſtors, and if inſtead of travell, idleneſſe; in place of induſtry, voluptuouſneſſe; and pleaſures, inſtead of continencie, and Iuſtice, diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and pride ſlip in; the greatneſſe and authoritie of families, doe inſtantly decay; and as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſayth;<note place="margin">Imperium his artibus reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur quibus initio partum eſt.

As to give indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, is not to underſtand how to beſtow, but is onely not to know how to keepe: So
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13114:140"/>to ſpend in theſe unworthy and frivolous occaſions, is not to be magnificent, it is not to be well adviſed. It is the object that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the forme, the eſteeme and value, to the action. But bounty is rightly beſtowed, and expences well placed; liberality caſts a a luſter, magnificency appeareth: and both theſe acquire great authority among men: to thoſe who rightly manage them.</p>
                  <p>To give, and doe good, is to imitate God, who hath not onely goodneſſe to will, but power and riches to enable him to do good. To imitate the bounty and magnificence of the Almighty, is to make our ſelves admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among men: and as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſayd in the Goſpell. <hi>Thoſe who are in honour and credit among men, are called Benefactors.</hi> Wherefore the rich ought to uſe it as we doe our bloud: which men more carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve than any thing whatſoever, when there is no neceſſity of ſpending it; but where there is queſtion of maintayning Gods, our Kings, or Countries cauſe, or to gaine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in a battaile; there is nothing which the couragious and magnanimous loſe more
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13114:140"/>freely or readily. Vpon ſuch occaſions it is cowardize to keepe our bloud, glory to loſe it. So the right uſe of riches, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them with moderate care, when it is neither neceſſary, uſefull, nor honourable to ſpend them; but when any occaſion is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either to doe good for others, or to ſhew magnificence in any famous act; It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to employ them at ſuch time with the like cheerefulneſſe as the Souldier diſpends his bloud, and at all times more to eſteeme Honour than gold, Authority than goods.</p>
                  <p>In this manner, liberality and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, are meanes of acquiring and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning credit by riches. But in caſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, States, and dignities; Iuſtice, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, love of the publicke, and the defence and protection of the poore and impotent: doe gaine very much. For when we ſee thoſe who are placed in dignities, to make no other uſe of their power, but to cauſe right and reaſon to take place, to ſupport in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, and to bereave iniquity of its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to doe ill; yet notwithſtanding, not to have a heart more puffed up with vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:13114:141"/>but only a mind farther charged with care, and not to grow paſſionate but for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke intereſt, and not ſeeke by their proper labours, but only the good and quiet of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not to rule for themſelves; but by commanding to be ſerviceable to all, to ſhew themſelves as terrours to oppreſſors, and the ſafety of the oppreſſed, and not to employ Authority but in defence of what needeth ſupport, or to reſiſt what cannot otherwiſe be repelled but by ſuch a Iuſtice as is armed with power: is the thing in truth which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſheth all men with admiration: It is that which acquireth, and maintaineth credit in publick opinion, cauſing thoſe who execute ſuch actions, to be reverenced as the Gods of other men. In this ſort, <hi>Iob</hi> repreſenteth the credit he had among thoſe of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, namely by his Iuſtice, and equity. <hi>When I drew neare</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the Gates of the Citie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. cap. <hi>23.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and when they prepared a Chaire for me in the middle of the place, the young men retyred, and the old men aroſe and ſtood up out of Honour; The Princes gave over ſpeaking, holding the finger on the mouth. The Governours were
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13114:141"/>ſilent, and their tongues were faſtened to their pallats. The Eare that heard my diſcourſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed me right happy, and the Eye contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my gravity, gave teſtimony to all men of me: Becauſe I had delivered the poore, who had only cryes and ſighes to defend them, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Orphan who found no reliefe: I have comforted the afflicted heart of the Widow, I cloathed my ſelfe with Iuſtice, as with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Honour, and a Diadem of Glory. I have bin the Blind mans Eye, the Lame mans foot, and the Poore mans Father.</hi> See here plainly (in this example drawne out of Scripture) how the credit &amp; authority of a Magiſtrate, is the fruit of his Iuſtice and Integrity. It is fitting that a Souldier know how to uſe his armes, if he will have them defend him: It is likewiſe requiſite, that he who is endowed with worthy qualities of the minde, know how to employ them, if hee intend they ſhould grace him, and put him into, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him in authority. For hee muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how to take his favourable times, moments, and occaſions to produce and manifeſt them. The obſervation of ſeaſons,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:13114:142"/>conſtellations, dayes, and houres, is not more neceſſary for thoſe who undertake huſbandry, to plant, ſow, graft, or to ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate ſucceſſefully. If either Prudence, or good fortune faile at this point, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver advance any thing: and be it that wee trip by indiſcretion, or ſlip by misfortune in this paſſage, we ſhall ſtill make the noſe and ground meet, ſave only that Impruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie herein is blamable, Infortunitie excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude all this diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Authority; The acquiring thereof is not all, we muſt likewiſe beware we abuſe it not, or looſe, or weaken it by-imploying it to every frivolous purpoſe, and without neceſſitie. For as thoſe who daily take Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, make it uſeleſſe and inefficacious, by the over frequent uſe thereof, taking away its vigour and operation by the cuſtome: So thoſe who in all affaires and accidents are overſtiffe, and will ſtraine their Authority to the height, enervate, and weaken it, ſo as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving never to ſlacken or unbend the bow, they in the end doe abſolutely breake it. It
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13114:142"/>is fitting ſometime to give that way in leſſe important occaſions, which a man would not doe, in the obtaining what is fitting in more principall occurrents: it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in paſſing a River to goe directly againſt the ſtreame, and to afflict our ſelves with an unneceſſary toyle, but rather to overcome its force in by aſing the current, and by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle deſcending and not by direct mounting to breake its force and make way. Who ſo knoweth how to give way when in diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ought, ſhall overcome all with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. We are to keepe the ſhoot-anchor for great tempeſts; Credit and Authority for eminent occaſions; ſmall ones ought not to detaine it, to the end, great ones may meet it, in its full meaſure. We have an excellent example hereof in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> where a famous Senatour <hi>(Cajus Caſsius)</hi> ſpeaketh theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table words to the Senate in a Subject of conſequence.<note place="margin">Tac. lib. <hi>14.</hi> Anual. <hi>1.</hi>

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13114:143"/>keep it intire for the Common-wealths neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if happily affaires ſtand in need of firme and free Counſell. Here you ſee how Prudence ought to husband Authority.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Rder is tranſmuted, when the Blinde lead the cleare-ſighted. Nevertheleſſe in worldly affaires, if Fortune guide not Prudence, yet doth ſhe at leaſt open the way for it, and cauſeth it to attaine its ayme. Prudence may paſſe on without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of fortune, but not arrive to the end wherto it aſpireth, without the favour of fortunes Convoy: So as Prudence inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſage Counſels, and Fortune affording happy events; The cleare-ſighted diſpoſeth the way, but the blind findeth the paſſage. It is not therefore ſufficient to have Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the propoſing of good Counſels,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:13114:143"/>and Credit and Authority to cauſe them to be received; if fortune accompany not the execution to make them ſucceſſefull. For though it be true that the Wiſeman ought not to be anſwerable for events, they being out of his Iurisdiction, but onely for ſuch Counſels as depend upon himſelfe, yet ſo it is notwithſtanding, that hee both ſeeketh and deſireth his pretenſions, as all other things doe, and when for the obtayning thereof, he hath performed what he eyther ought, or is able to effect; in concluſion he findeth himſelfe fruſtrate. The glory of his Prudence doth not greatly content him, without the fruit: and if he merit not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, yet ſeemeth he worthy of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſince the vulgar in matter of affaires re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the counſels, but the events: they more eſteeme a naughty counſell with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py event, than a good and ſage one, which ſucceedeth not; and good fortune once ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, both Wiſedome, Prudence, Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all things ſeeme to be wanting in the opinion of men. Truly thoſe vvho ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on their part performed what they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:13114:144"/>ought; yet doe only want ſucceſſe, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves with the anſwer, which <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramnes</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> Gentleman, made to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his friends, who wondred why his Enterpriſes were ſo improſpcrous, his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions being ſo pithy.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plut.</hi> in his Morals of the notable ſaings of Princes, Kings, and Captaines.</note> The reaſon (ſayd he) is, becauſe I am only Maſter of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but Fortune of the effects. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, when good counſels take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, men alwayes eſteeme them the beſt, and when they ſucceed not, the contrary event cauſeth them to be in ſome meaſure ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In a word, Prudence without ſucceſſe is a faire tree without fruit, and it is the fruit, not the tree; the ſucceſſe, and not the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, men chiefly deſire; ſince counſell is not ſought for, but in hope of the deſired event, the way but for the marke, the <hi>Medium</hi> but for the <hi>Terminus</hi> and the meanes but for the end.</p>
                  <p>Now that good Luck, whereof I ſpeake, proceeds not, either from that blinde For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which ſpirits yet more blinde have forged, nor from that imaginary deſtiny of inflexible decrees, whereto Heatheniſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:13114:144"/>hath ſubjected the Counſels even of <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe, nor on the diſpoſition of Celeſtiall bodies, whereto the vanity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity-caſters, ſubmit the whole order of things happening here on earth, whether Naturall, voluntary, or caſuall. Fortune is a Fable, Deſtiny a Dreame, and that neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the judiciall Aſtrologers pretend to bee impoſed by the Starres upon humane and free actions, or upon caſuall and accidentall events; is an evident errour, and a manifeſt impietie. For as concerning thoſe effects depending on naturall and neceſſary cauſes; the order of the World and Nature, ranging inferiour bodyes under ſuperiour ones; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to thoſe Authority, to thoſe dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and regulateth the actions of elementary Bodies by the Law of the influence of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Bodies. All that God hath made is eſtabliſhed with order (ſayth the Apoſtle).<note place="margin">Quae a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:13114:145"/>certaine, or limited cauſe. Nature being appointed to a certaine and infallible end,<note place="margin">Natura ad unum deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatur.</note> according to a Philoſophicall Maxim; what authority or command can ſhe have eyther over mans will being unbounded, free, and indifferent, to the one or other, of two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary objects; or over that, which being meerely caſuall, may eyther happen or not happen? The Starres being corporeall, what can they imprint upon the ſoule of man being ſpirituall; unreaſonable things, upon reaſonable ones; what is neceſſitated, upon what is free; or a thing determined upon an indifferent matter? In like manner, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning caſuall accidents what ſubordination can caſuall and accidentall things, have to the influences of Starres, being regulated, neceſſary, and infallible things? Is not this as much as to ſtrive againſt all reaſon, and to abuſe the weakneſſe and credulity of ſpirits; ſo much as only to dare (I will not ſay main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) but even to broach ſuch abſurd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. The Starres then (O man) ſhall be culpable of thine offences, authors of thy good workes, cauſes of thy proſperities,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:13114:145"/>inſtruments of thine infortunities: if you doe any good they ſhall have the merit, and conſequently the reward ſhall bee due to them, and not to you. If you offend, they ſhall beare the blame, and you may juſtly caſt the puniſhment upon them. And why are Lawes among you, if the Starres impoſe lawes upon you? If the ſtarres be the cauſes of your good and bad actions, and you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inſtruments, to whom is the penaltic of ill, or crowne of good due, to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or his tooles, to the cauſe, or to the inſtrument? See you not plainly, that if theſe propoſitions were true, you offer injury to the Starres to appropriate to your ſelves the reward of the good which they doe, and wrong to your ſelves, to inflict on your ſelves, the puniſhment of the evill you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not? Who ſees not how theſe propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions overthrow all reaſon, all juſtice, all vertue, all order, and all policie. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if it be the Starres which ſend good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, or fatalties, proſperities or adverſities to men; they then governe the world, it is they who raiſe ſome, and repreſſe others,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:13114:146"/>who diſtribute honours, give victories, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre Scepters, and diſpoſe of Kingdomes. But if this be thus, wherefore is merit raiſed in one time, and why at another time doth ambition obtaine all Honours? Is it becauſe the Starres one while make uſe of juſtice, an otherwhile of favours? Why in one age doth <hi>Industry</hi> conferre dignities, in another gold, or advantage in bloud: is it becauſe the Starres alter and accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the abuſe of times, as well as men doe? Why in one Nation doth Election conferre Crownes, in another Succeſſion? Is it by reaſon the Starres follow the faſhions of Countries; and doe diverſly diſtribute their benefits, according to the lawes of Kingdomes? But they doe well in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating themſelves to lawes, leſt they ſhould bee reſiſted, and finde ſome more compulſive thing then their owne power. Of two, borne at the ſame inſtant, and under the ſame Conſtellations, why is the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, the other miſerable? and the aſpect of Starres beeing ſo equall in both, why ſhould the effect bee ſo different? Who
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:13114:146"/>ſeeth not that the Startes conſiſting of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and neceſſary cauſes, appearing in all times and places, and in all and every where after the ſame faſhion, producing ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and various effects, according to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, moments, and circumſtances, cannot be any conſtant cauſe of humaine events; but in their conceipts, who have neyther rule nor reaſon.</p>

So as ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane actions, nor caſuall accidents, depend at all upon the diſpoſition of Stars, neither as efficient cauſes, nor as ſinges or tokens of what hapneth. Againſt the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Origen,</hi> who affirmed; that though the Starres cannot be the cauſes of what is done, eyther freely by man, or caſually by
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:13114:147"/>hazard, yet ſo it is, that one may know what will happen by the inſpection of Starres, as by the reading of a booke, where God hath written, and imprinted with his finger, in great and legible Characters, all the order of future things, as in a Table, or Patterne of his divine preſcience, which hee hath expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to mans ſight. An errour which the Scripture condemneth as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; forbidding us to have recourſe to Starres in any ſort, ſave only to know times and ſeaſons, and what hapneth by a natural, and neceſſary order.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, as for what concerneth humane actions, they have not any neare and interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our cauſe, but only mans free will, reſolving eyther upon good or evill: And as for more remote and exteriour cauſes: when man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateth rightly and ſutably to reaſon: God concurres, as the mooving cauſe, (eyther by his generall concurrency or particular, in an naturall order, as ſome will have it) natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and morall actions, or by a particular grace, or by a ſupernaturall order, in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and ſupernaturall actions. After the law:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:13114:148"/>(whether divine, or humane) the juſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of thoſe Countryes where we inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, and the good example eyther of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, or of ſuch with whom wee converſe, are the exteriour meanes, interiourly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the will, to incline it ſelfe toward good: And when man is inclinable to evill; his ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular actions, cannot be imputed (beſides his proper inclination being the interiour and principall motive) but to the Divels im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion to the perſwaſion of wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to pernicious example, to the attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Creatures, or to occaſions depending upon, and inclining toward vice: but to the Starres they can no way be referred, but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly: in that Starres may incite paſſions in the inferiour appetite, and theſe paſſions the will. As for what concerneth caſuall events (being the ſubject of our queſtion) they have no other cauſe, ſave onely the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and caſuall encounter of certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of times, places, and perſons, whereon ſuch uncertaine affects depend as upon unſure, and irregulated cauſes. But I call this chance caſuall (as to us) but not as
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:13114:148"/>to God: to whom nothing is accidentall, but all fore-ſeene by his preſcience, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his providence. For if even a poore Sparrow falls not to ground without Gods Providence (as the Goſpell ſpeaketh) were it not a manifeſt impietie to ſuppoſe, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing could happen to man which God foreſeeth not by his fore-knowledge: and if good; ordained by his expreſſe will: but if ill; permitted by his ſecret and hidden Will, but alwayes holy and juſt providence. So the good fortune (whereof we ſpeake) cauſing good deſignes and ſage counſels happily to ſucceed, proceed not but from the caſual diſpoſition, and encounter of circumſtances which are to concurre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the production of happy ſucceſſes: This being often caſuall, as concerning our providence, but at all times foreſcene, and ordered by that of God: who ſo well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the places times, perſons, and affayres, in favour of ſuch as he intendeth to make uſe of in the execution of eminent actions, as all things make way, and ſucceed favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for them.</p>

Gods providence diſpoſing all things in his favour, in this tiſſure, and linkes of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. Now were it that God by meanes of the temporall Monarkie in <hi>Rome,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to lay the foundation of the ſpirituall, which IESVS CHRIST, who was
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13114:150"/>pleaſed to appeare in this world, came to eſtabliſh in his Church; Or were it that by an univerſall peace proceeding from the conduct of one only head, he intended to diſpoſe men to the reception of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Meſsias,</hi> who brought peace upon the Earth; or were it, that by reducing all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under the authority of one Emperor, he would open by theſe means (as St. <hi>Leo</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth) the courſe of the Goſpell; which was to be announced, and publiſhed to all Nations: Or beſides all theſe reaſons were it for ſome other ſecret, or hidden cauſe, one may clearly know and perceive that this greatneſſe of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> is not a worke of his vertue but of his good fortune, and his good fortune, not a worke of hazard, Deſtiny, or the Starres, but of Gods Providence. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge this ſo vulgar, and well knowne an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, to ſhew that the good fortune which follows ſome perſons, depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth only on the concurrence of circumſtances rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and ordained by Gods Providence, willing that theſe their deſignes ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to make uſe of them toward the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:13114:151"/>of his Eternall decrees, whether they imagine or aime at any ſuch matter or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. If their deſignes be honeſt and juſt, he imployeth them by his expreſſe will; If wicked and unjuſt, he ſuffers them, and by his wiſdome draweth there out the good he intendeth.</p>
                  <p>But this good fortune ſeemes to be ſo farre affected to ſome, as it not onely followes their perſons, but even all things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, or that have relation unto them: as the Proſperitie of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> followed all his Lieutenants, who with incredible good fortune obtained for him infinite famous victories. <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> his fortunes followed his very pictures; and the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were of opinion, that his pourtraicts carried about the neck, made thoſe happy and fortunate who wore them: And wee reade in the hiſtories of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> how that famous Captaine <hi>Iohn Ziſca,</hi> who never loſt Battaile where himſelfe was preſent, had ſo great conffdence in his good fortune; as he ordained, that after his death his skin ſhould be taken off, and a Drum to be headed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:13114:151"/>with, which he commanded ſhould be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up, in the head of the Armie; perſwading himſelfe that the like good fortune conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually following his perſon whileſt helived, would likewiſe follow his skin and carkaſſe after his Deceaſe. The ſame felicity follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing famous Commanders in warre, cauſing them to performe brave exploits: doth likewiſe accompany (even in matters of peace) thoſe generous ſoules; whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and directions God bleſſeth for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of States: in ſuch a meaſure, as all they adviſe, ſucceeds, and is effectuall; when as whatſoever others, no leſſe prudent, and capable, ſhall propound, or ſeeme to ſet forward, becommeth vaine, and fruitleſſe: to ſhew us that in the decrees of humane Prudence; Fortune, (or to ſpeake more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) Gods Providence, will maintaine the Empire. But though the enjoyment of good fortune, be a thing not otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on us, then is the finding of a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den treaſure; which not the deſigne, but the luckie accident cauſeth to come to paſſe. Yet ſo it is that as a good husband maketh
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:13114:152"/>better uſe of this found treaſure, then a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall who ſpends all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo a Prudent and ſage perſon doth better employ his good fortune, then doth a foole or indiſcreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who looſeth it in abuſing it. It is God then who giveth this good fortune, but it is man who makes uſe of it: his favour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres it, but our Prudence muſt imploy, and manage it. And as Gods grace doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude but command mans cooperation in things concerning his eternall ſalvation: So Gods favour reſtraineth not, but requireth mans concurrencie in what hath reflection upon the conduct of temporall affaires; and the good fortune hee confer reth on ſome, hath ſuch depen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13114:152"/>himſelfe to ſtirre, and following his proper, and voluntary propenſion, upon the firſt motion his mover gives him, to finiſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him the deſigned worke. Good fortune followed <hi>Auguſtus</hi> from his Cradle even to his Grave; but obſerve how hee hath at all times employed it by his paines, husbanded it by his diligence, managed it by his wiſdome: ſo farre forth as he hath left it queſtionable, whether his Prudence be more obliged to his fortune, in having ſo faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed it, or his fortune to his Prudence, in having ſo ſagely conducted it. <hi>Alexander</hi> likewiſe was happy; Fortune ſeeming to make choyce of him for her Favourite; but had he ſlept in Idleneſſe, had he not ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Fortunes by his Travailes and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: his Fortune would never have layd him in the Bed of Victories and Triumphs, which acquired him the Title of <hi>Great.</hi> It is therfore neceſſary, for thoſe who are ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with good ſucceſſe in their deſignes &amp; counſels, to endeavor on their parts, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it profitably, &amp; to manage it diſcreetly; I ſay diſcreetly, ſince fortune is ofte offended
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:13114:153"/>with ſuch as abuſe her favors, who attempt all things, who unadviſedly undertake acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and who without ſounding the foard, fall into the precipice: ſuppoſing their good fortune hath compacted with their impradencie, obliging her ſelfe to follow it at all points. There is no treaſure ſo great, but Prodigality can draine it, nor Fortune ſo propitious, that folly will not fruſtrate. And it is ordinarily ſeene, that the moſt fortunate, are in concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cruſhed with the greateſt miſeries; for being over confident of their Proſperity, they commit the groſſeſt abſurdities: ſo as the ſame good Fortune which in favouring blindeth them, in blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding overthroweth them, cauſing them out of their owne folly to pay uſe for her former benefits. We are to acknowledg, that Fortune being blind may trip, ſtanding on a Bowle ſhe may turne, having Wings ſhe may flye away, If Prudence ſhew her not light, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ſettle her not, and the reverence we beare her oblige her not to ſtay.</p>
                  <p>Diſcretion ought to be ſeconded by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie; ſince Pride and inſolency are the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:13114:153"/>moſt dangerous rockes threatning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous. They are ordinarily engendred by good Fortune, yet doe they commonly ſpoyle and ruine their productrix. For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption moveth men, not at all to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their forces, throwing them headlong into hazards, whence good fortune cannot diſingage them; it cauſeth them to ſcorne others, this ſcorne rayſeth envie, out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie ariſe Counter checks, enmities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, which in the end ſhake the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the moſt proſperous; for having car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelves over inſolently in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:13114:154"/>puffe of a fraile Fortune, which may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him in a moment; as the Winde cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Ship to ſayle often leaves her in the middle of her Voyage. We are to conſider, that there are divers things, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute toward the conſervation, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of good Fortune, and chiefly the good will and friendſhip of other men, which is loſt by Pride, but gayned and maintayned by moderation. But ſince good Fortune is a heavenly guift, and a favour from God, (as I have formerly ſhewed) the moſt aſſured meanes to maintaine it, is an humble acknowledgment toward him who beſtoweth it; an acknowledgment conſiſting of two points: In rendring him the honour and glory by thankeſgiving; and in not imploying it, but in juſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, and conformable to his holy Will, by a pure, and upright intention. For when wee abuſe Gods Benefits, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Honour thereof to our ſelves, or when we imploy it only to our own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular profit, or when we make uſe thereof,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:13114:154"/>againſt the Giver; God ordinarily revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his guifts, or turneth them to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and Confuſion of ungratefull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon, wee ſee in Hiſtory, and dayly Experience, that thoſe who have the greateſt good Fortunes and Proſperities, in this World, often fall upon moſt fatall and unfortunate ends. Wherein wee are to acknowledge the Iuſtice of Gods Iudgements, in the chaſticement of their ingratitude.</p>

Fortitude therefore is a right neceſſary ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to performe, and execute, by overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all oppoſite reſiſtances. And it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are now to treate.</p>
                  <p>Nature hath imprinted in all things a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inclination, not only to procure good, and avoyde evill, but even to reſiſt things contrary, eyther hindring the purſuite of what is profitable, or caſting in our way, what is hurtfull unto us. Fire hath a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propenſion, not onely to raiſe it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, from interiour places, not agrecable
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:13114:155"/>thereto, and to tend to its naturall ſphere, and convenient reſidence; but moreover to reſiſt all things corrupting it, or hindring its mounting. Water hath not onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſlide toward the Sea, the place it ſeekes for; but a ſwiftneſſe and violence to make it ſelfe way over bankes, ditches, rockes, and mountains, reſiſting her courſe. A ſtone, beſides the weight, cauſing it to fall to its center, hath the ſtrength and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to cruſh and breake things oppoſite to its deſcent. All living creatures, beſides the naturall appetite, inciting and drawing them toward objects pleaſing to their ſenſes, are, beſides, ſtirred up, by a ſecret inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to arme themſelves, either with beake, teeth, nayles, or other naturall weapons, againſt whatſoever ſhall hinder them from the approach or enjoyment of thoſe things they affect. Man likewiſe is not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the concupiſcible apperite, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining him to the purchaſe of things ſutable to his nature, and to the avoyding their contraties, but with an iraſcible appetite likewiſe, ſerving him as a ſpur, and affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

The flaſhes, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this iraſcible appetite, as hop, bold neſſe, and choler (the three principall paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the iraſcible) being well ordered and conducted by reaſon, ſerve as ſouldiers to vertue, to fight under her Enſigne againſt ſuch difficulties, and reſiſtances as ſhee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters in the execution of her deſignes.

Wherefore the Philoſopher rejecteth this Propoſition as falſe. And the church it ſelfe, at a famous Councell in Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> time, condemned as heretickes, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Anachorites, who would introcuce a kinde of Apathie and impaſſibility. Since (ſaith this holy Father) he who wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth paſſions from men, doth as much as he who breaveth man of his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nay, I will ſay more, it is to rob man of the ſpurre toward vertue. For God hath ingrafted theſe tranſports and motions in man, not to follow them as bruit beaſts, without reaſon, or reſtraint; but to make reaſonable uſe thereof, as provocations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing us to the eſchewing of ill, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of good. Reaſon ſheweth man both good and ill; the Will inciteth us toward good, and diverteth us from ill: Paſſions well ordered by reaſon, ſerve as ſpurs to the will, to put her forward with more ardour,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:13114:157"/>and vehemencie whither reaſon conducts her, and her motion leads her; But chiefly when the good which vertue propoſeth is difficult, and hardly to be executed: for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue at ſuch times intreates the paſſions of the iraſcible, to lend her ſtrong hand, and as ſouldiers to take armes for her aſſiſtance; And preſently at her ſummons, <hi>Hope,</hi> (the firſt motion of the iraſcible) begins to arme and to put her in heart: <hi>Hope</hi> is ſeconded by a generous <hi>Audacitie,</hi> as with a ſecond Champion, who ſurmounting the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all obſtacles, which might ſtoppe his courſe, expoſeth and puts himſelfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without all feare of danger, to ſuch meanes as may ſerve him to execute his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. But if the reſiſtance of wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons oppoſe and croſſe him, <hi>Choler</hi> as a third ſouldier comes to the reſcue, which pricking and awaking the ſoule, as with a quickning ſting, heats and inflames her with a holy violence againſt iniquity. But by reaſon theſe three ſouldiers are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous if they be not moderated by the lawes of good diſcipline; and in that hope may
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:13114:157"/>prove raſh, Audacitie fooliſh, and Choler precipitate. Wee are therefore to be warie, leſt preſumptuous Hope engage us not in deſperate enterpriſes, indiſcreet boldneſſe into impoſſibilities, blinde Choler into ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable ruines: But rather that conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on guiding Hope, diſcretion boldneſſe, and reaſon Choler: vertue by this meanes may employ theſe three Champions in the ſage, valorous, and happy execution of her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For there is this difference betweene thoſe who follow the violence and bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of their paſſions; and others who regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them by reaſon, make uſe of them onely as incitements towards vertue: that the former fooliſh caſt themſelves upon the very ſwords, point which nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them; the latter imploy it prudently to the right uſe: the former hereby finding onely therein their ruine, the latter extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thence their glory. Thoſe if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe any good action, ſuffer themſelves to bee tranſported precipitately to their downefall, ſoone loſing their fyrineſſe in the progreſſe of what they undertake: The
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:13114:158"/>ſecond governing their tranſports by judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, revigorate their reſolutions; the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they engage themſelves in dangerous enterpriſes; ſhewing more courage in the concluſion, than in the beginning of their atchievements; to which purpoſe the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher hath pronounced this approved Maxime: <hi>That the Audacious before perils, put themſelves forward,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ariſt. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Eth. ca. <hi>7.</hi> and aces prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valentes ſunt anto pericula, in ipſis autem diſcedunt.</note> 
                     <hi>but in dangers they flie. Temerity caſts them thereinto, Timiditie forceth them to retire.</hi> Now this hapneth by reaſon this ſort of audacious people who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the firſt apprehenſion, give themſelves no leyſure to foreſee all the difficulties op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to their deſignes. So that as the <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats</hi> they caſt themſelves headlong into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, &amp; being once engaged in the medley, and there encountring greater oppoſitions than they imagined, they are amazed, they ſhrinke and recoyle. But thoſe who guide their rage by reaſon, foreſee all the perils they may probably encounter in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned affaires, without precipitately plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves thereinto; Wherefore, not paſſion, but judicious reaſon cauſing them
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:13114:158"/>to put themſelves upon dangers, they at firſt ſeeme coole, taking their times, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their forces: but being once throughly engaged in danger, they then incite their ſlackneſſe, as doth the Rhinocetos, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly employing the ſpurre of boldneſſe, and of Choler, to put forward their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But herein Prudence is to be required, as indeed all vertues hold hands, one having need of anothers mutuall aſſiſtance, but yet (as the Philoſopher ſayes) it is the proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the vertue of Fortitude, to rule and governe the iraſcible pasſions; Prudence doth indeed governe the motions of Hope, containing it within the limits of what it can, and ought to hope, according to the circumſtances of affaires in preſent agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince it is the ſigne of an imprudent ſoule, to caſt its hopes as farre as his deſires, and his deſires as farre as his dreames; But it is the vertue of Fortitude, which reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the motion of Audacitie within the bounds of diſcretion, and cholericke moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within the limits of reaſon. For a great
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13114:159"/>Fortitude is to be required for the repreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the formers indiſcretion, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters violence. And it is no ſmall argument of weakeneſſe, to ſuffer our ſelves without bit or bridle to be tranſported to their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                  <p>Ayre and fire are predominant in the compoſition of mans body, being the moſt perfect creature on earth: water and mudde in the compoſition of wormes, and other more imperfect creatures. The naturall conſtitution is a great diſpoſition toward morall vertues, being of the order of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, and namely toward the height of courage, fitting for thoſe who hold the principall rankes among men.

It was to this feare (ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>) that the ſo generous and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Spartans</hi> erected a Temple, ſignifying thereby, that the feare of committing any thing againſt their duties, was the nurſe of magnanimity. But the moſt noble love is
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:13114:167"/>to love God, the greateſt honour is to ſeeke his glory, and the moſt generous feare is to dread to offend him. <hi>Thy words have made my heart tremble</hi> (ſayd the Prophet <hi>David</hi>) he trembled before God,<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>118.</hi> A verbis tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is trepidavit cor meum.</note> and was confident before princes, proclayming his pleaſure unto them; before Lyons tearing them in peeces with his bare hands; before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Golias</hi> aſſaulting him without any weapon, ſave a ſilly Sling.

The ſame which Ornament is in all the works of Nature and Art, it ſeemes to me that Eloquence is in a man of excellent parts, adding to his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as luſtre doth to a Diamond, or lively colours to a picture, both ſtate, grace, and

But to what vertue is this ornament more ſutable, than to the vertue Politicke, which being borne for others, procuring the good of others, appearing (for generall profit) upon the Theater of honors; ought to iſſue forth well adorned, to ſhew her ſelfe in her full trim, with all things that may

I ſay likewiſe, uſefull: for even as in Nature Vtilitie and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are inſeparable, and there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more profitable for the world, than what doth moſt adorn it, as the Sun &amp; light.

I will not here reſolve upon, what the Orator <hi>Caſsins,</hi> and the Lawyer <hi>Scavola</hi> diſputed upon in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Orator: to weet, whether Prudence,<note place="margin">Cic. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Oratore.</note> or Eloquence laid the firſt foundations of Republickes and humane ſocieties: yet may one ſafely ſay; Iſraſh Eloquence were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make this maſter-piece, dumb Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could not effect it, but the one had need of the others aſſiſtance: Eloquence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the reaſons of Prudence, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the perſwaſions of Eloquence. But holy Writ, and Gods revelations ſummon me to ſoare yet higher, and to referre the Source of States and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:13114:173"/>not to men but God, not to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Prudence or Eloquence, which had never knowne neither that by its counſels, nor this by its allurements, how to curbe men naturally borne to liberty, under the yoke of obed once; but rather to the naturall inclination ingrafred by God in the ſoule of man, to live in ſociety, and for living in this ſocietie to eſtabliſh order, and to ſubmit themſelves unto ſome one.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is therefore a happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, when Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the faculty of diſcourſe, concurre joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their wiſdome and Authority, who rule, or governe men; nor can one deſire eyther a
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:13114:175"/>fairer ornament to their dignity, or ſtronger armes for their vertue. For we have not to deale with brute Beaſts, which abſolute force may captivate, nor with Angels without paſſion, to whom reaſon ſimply and barely propoſed may at all times ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie: But we have to doe with men, who have reaſon, which we are to know how to ſatisfie by reaſon, and paſſions which we are (when occaſion is offered) to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how eyther to appeaſe and ſweeten; or ſtirre up and inflame by diſcourſe: How often hath ſuſtice loſt her cauſe, for want of being repreſented with requiſite eſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie before men preoccupated with paſſion? What cauſed <hi>Socrates</hi> to be condemned in <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>P. Rutilius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> both the one, and the other being innocent; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the former contented himſelfe to refute the calumnies of his accuſers, by ſimple and naked negations; and the latter forbad his Advocates to uſe any ſtrength, or vehemency of ſpeech in the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his innocency. The Roman O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator indeed ſayth, that if one might plead
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:13114:175"/>his cauſe in <hi>Plato's</hi> imaginary Republicke, before Philoſophers exempt from all paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and humane perturbations; It were well to be wiſhed, that onely reaſon ſhould governe humane affaires, and that paſſion ſhould have no power over them. Since (it being ſo) the naked, and ſimple propoſition of what were juſt, would happily ſuffice without any Eloquence to draw them to good. But ſince only to wiſh this order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, is not to eſtabliſh the ſame; it is fitting (as much as we may) to rectifie the diſorder, and rather to reflect upon the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of preſent miſchiefes, then upon the vaine wiſhes of a happineſſe, not to be had. And ſince depraved inclinations, paſſions, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, voluptuouſneſſe, and perverſe habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, have ſo farre preoccupated humane ſpirits, as lyes ſeeme oftentimes Truth unto them, and iniquity Iuſtice; what better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to make way againſt all theſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to right, and reaſon, than the force of reaſon it ſelfe, explaned by Eloquence, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by lively words, and animated by efficacious geſtures and motions: Reaſon
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:13114:176"/>(I ſay) which preſented to ſo ill affected ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſimply, and nakedly, would be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected; but appearing with the grace and winning garb of this ſitting ornament, it winneth the hearts of the moſt refractari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is ſayd that the <hi>Aſpick,</hi> ſuffers it ſelfe to bee charmed by the Enchanters voyce, forgetting its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rage. The <hi>Lyra</hi> appeaſeth the <hi>Tyger,</hi> Muſick the <hi>Dolphin: Davids</hi> Harpe the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi> tormenting <hi>Saul:</hi> The ſound of <hi>Flutes</hi> aſſwageth the paines of the <hi>Gowt.</hi> And one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Muſitians, had a tune, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he could ſodainly calme the fire of his furie, and cauſe it to lay downe Armes in the heighth of his greateſt heate. Eloquence hath yet farther power over humaine paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to moderate, bend, calme, overcome, and to cauſe them (though it ſelfe unarmed) to yeild up their weapons to reaſon. Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence charmes the Sences, mollifieth harts, inciteth Affections, frameth deſires, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:13114:176"/>mens paſſions, commandeth without law, raigneth without Scepter, forceth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Serjeants, leaveth men to their freedome yet exerciſeth in them a ſecret Empire. It findes Wolves, and makes them Sheepe; encountreth Lions, and leaves them Lambs, not touching Bodies, but transforming Soules, and changing Wills, without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Nature. What was the Eloquence think you, of that Philoſopher, who commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Eloquence in preſence of a debauched young man, crowned with Flowers, clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his hands, tripping about, and dancing to the ſound of Flutes, in habit and geſture of one who celebrated the Feaſt of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> entring into his Schoole in this equipage, with purpoſe to ſcoffe at him, did ſo lively pierce him with the Darts of his diſcourſe, as hee preſently cauſed him to caſt his Flowers from him, to quit his caprings, to breake his Flutes, to ſettle his countenance, and to teſtifie by the change of his comportment, the alteration of his Spirit. What force (ſuppoſe you) had <hi>Pericles</hi> his Eloquence, being commonly termed Thunder, and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:13114:177"/>Lightning; who by ſpeaking, imprinted in all hearts, certaine ſtrong incitements, and ſtirred up all ſpirits with unuſual tranſports, enclining them to Wiſdome. What kinde of vehemency (imagine you) had that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Eloquence, which ſo long ſtayed the courſe and ſucceſſe of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> good Fortune, without any other armes then his tongue? What vigor had the ſpeech of <hi>Phocion,</hi> who a thouſand times rayſed the courage of his Country men, by his enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med diſcourſes, no leſſe than he did their Fortunes, by his victorious armes. But the authority theſe <hi>Orators</hi> acquired in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and the profit they brought to their Republick appeared clearely by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. At what time the <hi>Athenians</hi> reduced to extremity by <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> could not obtaine peace at his hands but under condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſend him (as Priſoners) their <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> and <hi>Orators;</hi> it came to this paſſe, that in retayning their <hi>Orators,</hi> they ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him in baniſhing their <hi>Captaines:</hi> ſo as therein they ſhewed how much they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Eloquence before valour; ſuppoſing
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:13114:177"/>it to be more availeable for them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the tongue, than the ſword in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. What ſhall I ſay of the <hi>Romans,</hi> with whom Eloquence did at all times march hand in hand with valour: theſe two ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rayſed their Republickes in Power, Greatneſſe, and Glory, above all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of the World.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruely as the popular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> have cauſed Eloquence to be of high eſteeme, ſo doth it (in truth) ſeeme that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence in ſuch places is moſt uſefull being of more ſplendour in popular eſtates, where it is neceſſary to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:13114:178"/>the people to what is profitable for the publick, than in Monarchicall States where thoſe who are encharged with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like government, are onely to propoſe their counſels and opinions to the Soveraigne, &amp; thereupon receiving his commands to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the ſame to the people; which without all compariſon is more majeſticall, firme, &amp; ſolid for the good and quiet of men, then the opinion; or advice of a Tribune or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, confirmed by the ſuffrages of a raſh multitude. It therefore affords not ſo large a Field to the power of ſpirit, nor ſo ample a ſubject to Eloquence. Nevertheleſſe, as certaine Birds who make no uſe of their wings for flying, and ſoaring in the ayre, yet employ them notwithſtanding in their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on earth, therewith putting themſelues forward with more ſpeed and ſtrength: So Eloquence not meeting with thoſe ſpacious places in Monarchies to ſoare in (if I may ſo ſay) with diſplayed wings, doth yet at all times ſhew her dexterity and promptitude even in thoſe ſtraight limits encloſing her: and her wings, though uſeleſſe unto her for
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:13114:178"/>flying, do yet at leaſt help her to walk with greater vivacity.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the inconſtancie of worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires affordeth but over-many ſubjects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in beſt ſetled Kingdomes; on the one ſide to cauſe the peoples fidelity to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare towards their Soveraigne, and on the other ſide to employ Eloquence in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and for publike profit. Occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (I ſay) which are no more to be deſired than Phiſick: but when theſe occurrents happen, Eloquence (at ſuch time) joyned with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and authority, ſheweth her abilities high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advancing the glory of her Author. And when we have ſayd all, Eloquence is a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Collet for a Diamond, and a precious ornament, eyther to vertue or dignity, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſing that, and raiſing this, it makes both of them eſtimable, and which raviſhing men by her inticements as the <hi>Roman</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor obſerveth, cauſeth them who poſſeſſe it to be admired and reverenced as little Gods among men.</p>
                  <p>But moſt commonly whatſoever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is rare: There is but one Sunne in the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:13114:179"/>Firmament, yet above a thouſand Starres, pibble ſtones are plentifull, but Diamonds are only found in ſome corner of the world; Carbuncles are ſcarcely diſcovered; Incenſe is only gathered in <hi>Saba,</hi> the <hi>Balſamum</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore but in <hi>Iudea;</hi> Amber-greece but in <hi>Orcades:</hi> it ſeeming that Nature deſired to adde raritie to the excellencie of her moſt beautifull workes, thereby to augment the eſtimation. The <hi>Roman</hi> Orator hath parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly obſerved Natures ſterility and nigar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in the production of Eloquent perſons. She hath afforded (ſaith he) ſpeech to all, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome; but Eloquence to ſo few, as it is wonderfull to conſider how in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and States there are a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of excellent Captaines, learned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, perfect Architects, compleat Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, right ſufficient Artiſts, in all the liberall and mechanicall Sciences, and ſcarce one indifferent Orator; which truely is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, ſince Eloquence hath never beene wanting unleſſe (perhaps) in this age, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing but the Gold of Honour and and recompence; beeing (as an ancient
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:13114:179"/>Authour ſaith) the two Divels governing all humane counſels and enterpriſes. Yet notwithſtanding Floquence (though ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured) rewarded, and laboured for by all the beſt wits that ever were in Fame, hath ſucceſſefully hapned to ſo few, and ſo rarely, as peradventure the <hi>Phoenix</hi> (though the onely of her kinde) is more frequent in the World than an excellent Oratour. If it bee true, that in every age (at leaſt) one may be found. <hi>Greece</hi> hardly produced foure or five, and <hi>Rome</hi> two or three, that merit the Title of Eloquent. And beſides, (even in this ſo little a number) one would ſay that Nature deſired to be ſparing, contenting her ſelfe to beſtow on each of theſe ſome parts of Eloquence, fearing (it may be) ſhee ſhould have undertaken too great a taske and an over hardy enterpriſe, had ſhe eſſayed to aſſemble all the qualities thereof in one man. For according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Orators judgement who made the lots. <hi>Socrates,</hi> had the ſweetneſſe; <hi>Lyſias,</hi> the ſharpeneſſe; <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perides,</hi> the exactneſſe; <hi>Aeſchines,</hi> the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> the force and vehemence
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:13114:180"/>of Oratorie; to whom (I pray you) have all theſe perfections joyntly met, to make up a maſter peece of Eloquence? As for the <hi>Romans: Cicero</hi> hath, with advantage gained the prize from all thoſe of his Nation and perhaps from all the <hi>Greekes;</hi> And <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> made no queſtion to equalize this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wit to the greatneſſe of the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> yet doth he acknowledge himſelfe to come farre ſhort of the <hi>Idea</hi> he conceived of a perfect Orator. So as Cenſurers, and Criticks, have (in him) eſpyed, I know not what ſeeming flat diffuſe and ſinewleſſe; It being ſayd of him as he ſayd of <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> that he much pleaſed his eares, but fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them not at all. I will ſpeake nothing of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Orators, who in their diſcourſe have ſought for a more ſublime thing than <hi>Eloquence,</hi> though ſome among them, and namely the Fathers of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, have bin therewith ſufficiently furniſhed had they bin pleaſed to make ſhew thereof not onely to come neare, but even to equalize Secular Orators. But as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayd of a <hi>Philoſopher, They rather ſought to ſpeake and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:13114:180"/>write to hearts, than to eares.</hi> They were Gods <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> and their <hi>Embaſſie</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to hearts. <hi>Speake to the heart of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> ſayd God to his Prophet. But men are eyther ſo weake, as they doe nothing of perfection, or ſo curious as nothing contents them: ſo as it is no marvell, if they have conceived ſuch an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> as whereof they neither have bin, nor are able ever to ſee the effect. But to returne to <hi>Plato,</hi> and to ſpeake only of what hath heretofore beene, and may againe happen. There are ſo many qualities requiſite to forme an <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> perſon, not ſuch an one as may bee imagined, but ſuch an one as may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture be met withall; that when Nature produceth any one ſuch, ſhe aſſembles (as did <hi>Xeuxis</hi>) all the rare touches of moſt compleat Beauties to make this portrait. She affords him a quick apprehenſion, a fruitfull imagination, an happy memory, a ſolide judgement, a cleare wit, an infatigable pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to gather (as doth the Bee) the flowers of all Bookes, and Sciences, the reaſons of Philoſophers, Logicians arguments, the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:13114:181"/>ſecrets of Naturaliſts, the Decrees of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Hiſtorians Treaſures, Grammarians purity, the tearmes of Poets. and enricheth him with the ſpoyles of all Liberall, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Arts. For Eloquence ought to ſpeak of all things with propriety, aboundance, and Ornament, never becomming empty; and to reſemble a River, which never ſtayes but runs inceſſantly, one while ſlyding eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over the Plaines, otherwhiles, roaring im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly athwart Mountaines; ſometimes boyling and foaming againſt Rockes, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all before him that he encounters, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along all impediments, alwayes full, ever equall, ſave onely that he ſwelleth, and mounteth the farther he is from his Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ſhewing at all times the moſt vigour where hee encounters moſt Difficulties. <hi>That Beautie</hi> (ſayth <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>wherein ſome one agreeable Feature onely appeareth deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the name of Beautie.</hi> That For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is not faire, where onely two or three goodly Trees appeare among a ſort of ſhrubbes; nor is that Oration Eloquent, where one Member onely is compleat,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:13114:181"/>and the reſt defectuous; but that wherein the Proportion, and Perfection of the whole, crowneth with its luſtre the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of each part. Eloquence is a Queene, who goeth not any whither without the attendance of her Ornaments, never ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyther want, or ſcarcitie, preſenting her ſelfe in all places where ſhee comes, with Gracefulneſſe and Majeſticall Royaltie: and for the Entertainement of the Traine, and Pompe ſutable to her qualitie, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth Tribute from all Arts, and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Wherefore the ancient <hi>Greekes</hi> did not ſeparate <hi>Eloquence</hi> from <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> and knowledge of things, but termes it, the Wiſedome and facultie of well-ſpeaking (as the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.)</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the other ſide, this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of words, voyd of ſolidity, being in ſo great fame in this Age, deſerveth (in the opinion of the Wiſe) the onely Title of Folly. Poets faine, how <hi>Ixion</hi> embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Cloud in place of the true <hi>Iuno,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got onely <hi>Centaures</hi> inſteed of Children:
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:13114:182"/>So theſe talkers, embracing in their diſcourſe, the ſhadowes and Phantaſmes of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, for want of the reaſons of ſolid learning, ſuppoſing thereby to produce E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, bring forth onely a Monſter, cauſing by its novelty, admiration in weak ſpirits, but horrour by its deformity to all judicious perſons. Their diſcourſes are as theſe imperfect Creatures which are termed <hi>Inſecta:</hi> riſing not by generation but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; ſince not the vigour of ſpirit, but the vanity of a flowing braine produceth them. The wit not nouriſhed with the good juyce of Letters, and Sciences, and chiefly of Philoſophy, ſtriveth in vaine to conceive, or utter a maſculine, and vigorous diſcourſe; and if it chance to vent any thing by the force of imagination, the ſound whereof may ſeeme to appeare of weight, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it is but the found of an empty Cave, puffed with Winde, and voyd of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt Science, and Learning, being onely the ſeed, and ſubſtance of Eloquence, there is farther to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired (for the conferring Eſſence, and forme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) Fecundity for Invention, Diſcretion for Choice, Cleareneſſe for Diſpoſing, Facility for Expreſſion, Elegancy for Ornament, Example for Illuſtration, Motions for Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; Tunableneſſe of voyce, and Geſture of Body, proportioned and framed for the addition of Perfection. And (for the further acquiſition of all theſe parts) an excellent naturall wit, a deepe ſtudy with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practiſe. By this, the ancient <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> (laborious, and aſſiduous in that exerciſe) obtained their great glory in this Art. Which our <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> hath well obſerved in his <hi>French</hi> Eloquence,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:13114:183"/>where he hath ſo worthily handled this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that to ſpeake after him were to gleane after harveſters, and to croake after the Swans tune. I will only ſay, that comparing the Writings of Ancients, with this brood and ſwarme of Bookes, which this Age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth as Muſhromes over Night, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded next morning; one may eaſily obſerve the ſame difference, as there is betweene the Dwarfe like men of theſe times, and thoſe huge and robuſtious <hi>Heroes</hi> of the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, deſcribed unto us by <hi>Poets.</hi> Now be it that each thing háth its reſolution, or that Nature is decayed, or the World inclining toward old Age, is unable to forme ſo full and vigorous a diſcourſe, as in the age of its virility; but returnes as decayed old men to its childiſh babling; or that men in vaine deſire to ſearch the cauſe of this decay, the effects at leaſt are evident. It is needleſſe to ſpeake any thing of theſe Court writers, and Diſcourſers, who of themſelves arrogate the authority of preſcribing Lawes to Speech, and Eloquence, yet have none other than a Minion like Gebridge, and ſome cold and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:13114:183"/>dull rancounters of words and phraſes; like thoſe Sophiſts whom <hi>Plato</hi> in mockery calls, <hi>Fencers of words;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now ſpeake of thoſe, who after the faſhion of Tragedians, will march all upon the buskin, ſavoring only ſingularitie; thinking they ſpeake not at all, if they aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh not men with unheard of, monſtrous, and prodigious matters. As thoſe greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſſe-girls, who finde no taſte in any meats which Nature alloweth of, or are comfortable to the ſtomacke, but chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eat aſhes, coales, and ſpiders, a true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of a depraved taſte. So the wits of this age, reiecting in their diſcourſe all ſolid conceptions, conformable to reaſon, and common ſence; as vulgar and deſpicable fall into fantaſticke imaginations, having
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:13114:184"/>neither ſenſe nor foundation in their brains, a ſigne doubtleſſe of wits weak by Nature, or weakened by vanitie. The one perhaps meriting excuſe, the other worthy of double reproch. When they undertake a diſcourſe, they enter not upon the matter, nor do they aime at the concluſion, but ſtray at the firſt ſtep, and preſently looſe themſelves in a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of unprofitable paſſages, confuſed adaptations, &amp; frivolous ſimilitudes, which they ioine and patch together as ſhreds of divers ſtuffes and colours, with rough, and courſe thred. If they happen upon any ſtrange, obſcure, or blundered conception, their diſcourſ catches hold, &amp; draws it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as the wind <hi>Caecias,</hi> doth clouds &amp; ſtorms. If there be any new found ſtone in India, if any floure, or fruit at the worlds end, whoſe name is unheard of: If any monſtrous <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's</hi> amongſt <hi>Plato's</hi> and the <hi>Rabines</hi> Dreames; if any ruſty medall in the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquitie: there is no ſubiect, how far fetcht ſoever, but is brought in, and drawn by top or tayle.

Now this proceeds from an unbridled deſire, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing theſe wits void of common ſenſe, to appeare learned, and eminent before the ignorant, not being aware how therein they ſhew themſelves ignorant before men of underſtanding, and ridiculous before all cleare Iudgements. For it is the cuſtome of poore men who deſire to appeare rich, to adde either to their habites, their houſes, moveables, or banquets, certaine unſeemely and unſeaſonable ornaments, clearly out of ordinary uſe, ſtil the more therein publiſhing their poverty, where they thinke to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it: and as ugly women who borrow the counterfeit beauties out of painting and Vermilion, thereby diſcovering their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comelineſſe to their farther ſhame, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to hide it.

To avoyd the common faſhion in matter of apparell, is to make our ſelves ridiculous: To quit ordinary terms, &amp; conceptions in diſcourſe, is to caſt our ſelves into extravagancies.

Philoſophy termeth the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bodies ſimple in compariſon of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary bodyes; and <hi>Theologie</hi> attributes ſimplicity to God and Angels, in reſpect of things compoſed of body, and matter: ſo as ſimplicity (taken in the true ſenſe) is the perfection of things not ſignifying any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of gracefulneſſe, ornament, or beauty, but an happy privation of impurity, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and mixture. The Heavens as they are the moſt ſimple bodyes, ſo are they the faireſt, and moſt luminous, their Beauty proceeding from their ſimplicity, and ſeparation from all mixture of ſtrange Bodyes. The Angels, more ſimple than all other created things, are likewiſe more excellent: their excellency conſiſting in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:13114:189"/>that they are ſingle and divided from the Vnion, and marriage of materiall things. God who is moſt ſimple, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, his perfection ariſeth out of his ſimplicity, and his ſimplicity from his being exempt from any compoſition: which indeed denoteth a defect in things, not having all in them, but are forced to crave allyance of ſome Exteriour thing for the obtayning of what is deficient in themſelves. So the moſt excellent and elegant Oration is that which is the moſt ſimple, not in beeing unfurniſhed of her Graces, and Attractions, but in having all her Ornaments in their vigour, her Colours in their proper juyce, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out borrowing ſtrange, farre-fetcht, and ſuperfluous Ornaments, to extract her Beauty out of her proper ſubſtance, her Vermilion from her good Bloud, and as the Gold his ſhine from his owne ſoliditie.</p>
                  <p>This is the Eloquence worthy of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in authority, who are to comport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Diſcourſe, as in their apparell,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:13114:190"/>wherein they avoyd not ornament and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but curious faſhions, and the borrowed embelliſhments of affected artifice. But if the meaneſſe of their habit ſeem ſomething to derogate from their State, the bareneſſe of diſcourſe ſeemes more to debaſe it: ſince the robe onely ſheweth what they are out of themſelves, and ſpeech marketh what they are in themſelves. Beſides, if God hath beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified all the parts of mans Body, and above the reſt, thoſe moſt expoſed to view, as the Eye and Face with Graces and Attractions, why ſhould any deſire that the principall part in man, diſcovering and ſhewing the Soule, and the interiour, declaring and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting man; Speech (I ſay) the lively I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the heart and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:13114:190"/>cauſing him to appeare and ſhine, it being the lively pourtrait of what is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in man, to wit, reaſon, and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. If therefore it be his ſplendor, is it ſeemely it ſhould be voyd of gracefulneſſe, or this ſpeciall ornament abject, and neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? What can cauſe him to ſhine, if what ought to be his light, darken him: &amp; whence ſhould his honour iſſue, if his principall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament diſhonor him? Beauty takes nothing from requiſite ſimplicity in a grave and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Oration, but is rather its ſimplicity; ſince in ſpeech, as in all other things, ſimple and pure: pure, and faire; faire, and perfect, are the ſame. Holy Scripture being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed word of God, is ſimple; not ſoft, enervate, forceleſſe, or idle; as is their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, who ſtrive to defend their ruſticity, by this example, and becauſe they are both lofty and lowly, they preſently ſuppoſe they have attained the glory proper to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Divine ſtyle: whereas in truth that is rather; quick, energicall, powerfull, and ſpiritfull, ſtored with delightfull graces, of tranſperſing points, enflaming motives,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:13114:191"/>and of ſecret but divine ſweetneſſes, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more attractions, than all the Orators on Earth have ever beene able to utter in their elaborate diſcourſes. <hi>Thy word is more ſweet than honey to my mouth,</hi> (ſayd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.) Who hearkens thereto finds himſelfe catched, who reades therein is transformed. And that <hi>Theopompus</hi> who admired the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den energy of this divine word, yet offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with the ſimplicity of its termes, ſeeking to beautifie it with the flowers and pruned words of humane Eloquence (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> reporteth) was not aware that its ſimplicity is more perſwaſive, than all the Art of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: Being therefore puniſhed from above for this tranſport of folly, he taſted the juſt puniſhment of his idle enterpriſe. Simplicity therefore excludeth not the gracefulneſſe, and ſtrength of Diſcourſe, but onely the paint and ſuperfluity, which (to ſay truly) though adorned with painefull reſerches; and pompous ſpeeches, doth notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bereave it of its ſinewes, and Originall Beautie.</p>

Thy diſcourſes are as the tall and fayre Cypreſſe trees, which beare no fruit (ſayd an Antient, to a young man) who mounted upon the Orators chayre, entertained the people with vaine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſpeeches. It is indeed allowable for Sophiſters and Declamours who ſpeak not but to pleaſe an Idle aſſembly, to frame to themſelves Imaginary ſubiects, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to inlarge their diſcourſe, and to ſport at pleaſure to excite a vaine admiration, and beare away a more vaine applauſe, ſowing winde, and gathering ſmoke. But theſe mouthes (as that of Oracles) which are conſecrated to publicke utility, are never to ſcatter their words in the ayre, nor ever to enter upon ſubiects of importance (though plauſible and pleaſing to the vulgar) out of their due places, times, and ſeaſons; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all times to attend the neceſſitie, and opportunity of ſpeaking in hope of fruit. Speech is like graine, which out of fitting places, and convenient ſeaſons, though
